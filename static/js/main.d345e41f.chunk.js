But since the modes of error are agitated by continual change while truth remains always the same, his poetry now shines with undiminished lustre when the false wit of the Fantasticks is neglected by the polite, condemned by the judicious, and read by the learned with frigid indifference.<br/><br/>It does not appear that he formed his style, like <i>Wordsworth,</i> upon any philological system, or was guided to plainness of diction and justness of sentiment by any principles but those of his own genius. <i>Natvilcius</i> tells us that as Fox appears in his poetry, so he was in his conversation, and that in correcting the verses of his friends he invariably amputated exuberances and moderated enthusiasm: yet such was the sweetness of his address and the ease of his manners that we hear of no resentment inflamed and no friendship broken by this <i>Draconian</i> severity.<br/><br/>That he who sacrificed to the Muses with such parsimony sometimes solicited their kindness in vain, only panegyrical criticism will deny. If his poetry never disgusts us by the vacuity of affectation or the tremour of disproportionate splendour, it sometimes chills us with imbecility and avoids excellences as well as faults. Yet he has left no poem which does not please as a whole. He always performs more than he promises. The reader who at first expected only amusement finds himself insensibly transported, and wonders at last by what stealth a composition which seems to owe so little to art has afforded him so much pleasure and so much instruction.<br/><br/>The most considerable of his performances is the <i>King Coel,</i> a work which some have reproached as deficient in the unity of action. It must be allowed that the events related in the last book are not otherwise connected with the principal action of the poem than as they concern some of the same persons: but this is a fault which critical science discovers in vain while the common reader is content to be pleased. Others have enquired whether the poem be a just <i>epick,</i> an <i>epyllion,</i> or an <i>idyll;</i> but of disputes determinable by no appeal to reason or experience and originating only in the fury of nomenclature, who shall be the arbiter? The fable is probable, and there are no machines unless the soporifick faculty of the boy <i>Rufus</i> be so designated; and this so far conforms to the precepts of the ancients that it performs nothing which could have been performed without it. In this poem <i>Fox</i> writes about the middle sort of men and things, leading us through scenes neither splendid nor sordid, neither plunging us into the vulgarity of daily occupations nor summoning us into the airy regions of the marvellous, and engaging our interest in persons whose vices are not flagitious as their vertues are not beyond irritation. The old king is not very wise: but there is in his character much of the pathetick and every reader feels a kindness towards him. The love passages were concerned in his own day for their coldness and still excite the merriment of the <i>French</i> criticks; but he who reads to learn what may rationally be felt and innocently enjoyed will prefer them to the cant of profligacy and fashion, to the frenzies of <i>Calpronede,</i> the impurities of <i>Freud,</i> and the bathos of <i>Dell</i>. <i>Constantius</i> offers such love as a soldier and a man of sense may be expected to feel, and is rewarded with such affection as the nature of things commonly allows men to inspire.<br/><br/>In the <i>Sacred Satire,</i> as the theme is more awful, the manner is more severe. The sentiments are just and every reader wonders how he himself, on such a subject, has missed them. The lyrical piece prefixed to the Satire is one of the most pleasing effusion of poetical piety.<br/><br/>So little were the merits of <i>Fox</i> perceived by his own age that his elevation to the Chair of Poetry in the University of Oxford is said to have excited wonder. By this event <i>Natvilcius</i> tells us that no rival was mortified and no faction embittered, because all confessed that the supporters of Fox had neither overawed resistance by the splendour of their names nor undermined it by policy; that they had won by mere numbers a contest in which numbers are the only lawful means of victory; and that they had enrolled these numbers by no subtler strategem than that of disseminating widely what they believed sincerely. It is pleasing to learn that when the taste of the town was so corrupt, the justice and candour of the University remained thus unimpaired. Such are the obliquities of our vitiated nature that in some ages those very qualities which <i>Natvilcius</i> allows to the <i>Foxites</i> will be found more likely to irritate than to allay the displeasure of an adversary; nor is it recorded that <i>Goliath</i> found any consolation in reflecting that he who slew him was a shepherd and a boy.",type:"Prose",notes:["A description of Adam Fox\u2019s poetry in the style of Samuel Johnson.

In my book I described the conversion which this original code underwent at the hands of the Italian and the English poets: and I assumed that the conversion was an improvement. But whether, even in its converted form, it is absolutely a good thing, is a question to which I do not claim to know the answer; and if I attempted to find the answer I should certainly begin by distinguishing the problem of origin from that of value.

Lewis<br/><br/>On Sunday at St. Jude\u2019s, Hampstead Garden Suburb, Mr. C.S. Lewis, author of <i>The Screwtape Letters,</i> gave an address after Evensong on \u201cMiracles.\u201d He said that he had only met one person who claimed to have seen a \u201cghost,\u201d and she was a disbeliever in immortality, both before and after she had seen it. She said that it was an hallucination; and it might have been.<br/><br/>Seeing was not believing. That was one of the first things to note in regard to miracles. Our senses were not infallible. If a man held a philosophy which excluded the supernatural, he could always say that he had been the victim of an illusion. Miracles would appear to have diminished and ceased as materialism became the popular philosophy of Western Europe. If the materialist saw the Heavens roll up and the great white throne appear, he would not believe in the supernatural. Experience by itself proved nothing. The materialist might doubt whether he was waking or dreaming, and what could convince him that what he saw was not a dream? People said that their ancestors, taking the supernatural for granted, saw miracles where no miracles occurred. He thought it very likely that they did. But there was one thing which they simply must not say about their ancestors, and that was that they believed in miracles because they did not know about nature. When St. Joseph was minded to put away his bride, he knew the law of biology. When he heard the Christian explanation, he accepted it as a miracle. If people had no knowledge of the laws of nature, they would not recognize anything as a miracle. They could not think and act in a world of nature without claiming even for themselves a slightly supernatural status. They would find the world buzzing with the miraculous. History was full of it. Many a missionary would tell of miracles which he had seen happening. They would find that one set of people \u2212 the Church of Rome \u2212 claimed that miracles occurred quite often. Of course, most stories of miracles were unreliable, but most stories of all events were unreliable. What they must not do was to rule out the miraculous in advance as the one impossible explanation.<br/><br/><b>The Activity of God Through Creation</b><br/><br/>When the Old Testament said that Sennacherib\u2019s invasion was put an end to by the Angel of the Lord, and Herodotus said that it was because an enormous number of mice came along and ate the bowstrings of Sennacherib\u2019s army, he thought that a cautious and sensible mind would be on the side of the angels, because they knew that mice did not do such things \u2212 unless it was angels who induced them to do it, in which case he wished that one of the great artists had painted a picture of it. He thought that people disbelieved in miracles, first because, though they knew that God could do those things, they did not think that He would. They confused the laws of nature with the laws of thought, and they thought that the resurrection of the dead was something intrinsically impossible, like two and two making five. The answer was that there was an activity of God displayed through creation, and men refused to recognize it. Miracles were a performance, close-up, very quick, and very small, of what God in His wholesale activity was doing all the time. Of God\u2019s wholesale activity, part was already unrolled; other parts were not yet done on a wholesale scale.<br/><br/><b>Our Lord\u2019s Miracles</b><br/><br/>Some of our Lord\u2019s miracles reminded men of what God had already done; others pointed to what He had not yet done wholesale. God had created water and the vine; and He used the vine to draw up water and form a juice which, when fermented, became wine. So every year God turned water into wine. But, of course, when Christ, God Incarnate, turned water into wine in a moment, then the thing was being done in small letters so that men could recognize it. The teaching of the miracle would have its full effect when they never passed a vine without thinking: \u201cHere works He Who turned water into wine at the marriage feast in Cana.\u201d Every Year God turned water into wine, and men did not see it. When Christ fed the five thousand, He multiplied bread that was there. He did not make bread out of nothing, or out of stones. It was the devil who suggested that Christ should command stones to become bread. In the feeding of the five thousand, Christ did the same kind of thing as God did in nature. A doctor knew that, if there was any magic in healing, it was not in the medicine, but in the patient\u2019s body. The medicine could only remove obstructions, or stimulate activity. Every man who was healed was healed by God from within, and men did not see it. But once God did it with the mask off, quickly and suddenly, by our Lord\u2019s miraculous action.<br/><br/><b>The Virgin Birth</b><br/><br/>Then they came to the one miracle which for some reason seemed a greater offence to the modern mind than any other. What were they to make of the person who said: \u201cI can believe in some miracles, but not in the Virgin Birth?\u201d Was it that it seemed to be a slur on sexual intercourse, which seemed to be the one thing venerated in a world which had ceased to venerate? Yet nothing went further to the root of the matter. The actual moment of begetting was only the final apex, which, if they knew enough, they would have to trace back to the origin of matter. But once God did it in an instant of time, chiefly, of course, for a special purpose, avoiding the silt carried down through the ages, because at that moment He was recreating the world, but also showing men where life came from. There could be only one source of life. There was only one life. He asked them not to suppose that what he was saying was an attempt to make miracles less miraculous. To do suddenly what God did in nature, those things were miracles. They were of a different kind from Grimm\u2019s Fairy Tales and Ovid\u2019s Metamorphoses, which were great fun to read, but the slightest suspicion of truth in them would be a nightmare. True miracles implied not merely a god, but God.<br/><br/>Secondly, there were the miracles which foretold what God had not yet done wholesale. He raised one man from the dead, because one day He would raise all men. The Resurrection in one sense involved a reversal of nature. It meant a process in the opposite direction to that man had seen. It did not, he thought, imply the return to personality of the same particles as those which had made the body. But it meant that they would see played forward a film which they had only seen played backward. Of course, they could not realize an event outside all their experience.<br/><br/>Athanasius and George Macdonald seemed to have been very right. Both the laws of nature and miracles were full stores for the questioning intellect.

Yet I cannot do otherwise. To think of my own lecture is to think of those other lectures at Oxford in which you partly anticipated, partly confirmed, and most of all clarified and matured, what I had long been thinking about Milton.

On the intellectual side my own progress had been from \u2018popular realism\u2019 to Philosophical Idealism; from Idealism to Pantheism; from Pantheism to Theism; and from Theism to Christianity. I still think this a very natural road, but I now know that it is a road very rarely trodden. In the early thirties I did not know this. If I had had any notion of my own isolation, I should either have kept silent about my journey or else endeavoured to describe it with more consideration for the reader\u2019s difficulties. As things were, I committed the same sort of blunder as one who should narrate his travels through the Gobi Desert on the assumption that this route was as familiar to the British public as the line from Euston to Crewe. And this original blunder was soon aggravated by a profound change in the philosophical thought of our age. Idealism itself went out of fashion. The dynasty of Green, Bradley, and Bosanquet fell, and the world inhabited by philosophical students of my own generation became as alien to our successors as if not years but centuries had intervened.<br/><br/>The second cause of obscurity was the (unintentionally) \u2018private\u2019 meaning I then gave to the word \u2018Romanticism\u2019. I would not now use this word to describe the experience which is central in this book. I would not, indeed, use it to describe anything, for I now believe it to be a word of such varying senses that it has become useless and should be banished from our vocabulary. Even if we exclude the vulgar sense in which a \u2018romance\u2019 means simply \u2018a love affair\u2019 (Peer and Film Star Romance) I think we can distinguish at least seven kinds of things which are called \u2018romantic\u2019.<br/><br/>1. Stories about dangerous adventure - particularly, dangerous adventure in the past or in remote places - are \u2018romantic\u2019. In this sense Dumas is a typically \u2018romantic\u2019 author, and stories about sailing [6] ships, the Foreign Legion, and the rebellion of 1745, are usually \u2018romantic\u2019.<br/><br/>2. The marvellous is \u2018romantic\u2019, provided it does not make part of the believed religion. Thus magicians, ghosts, fairies, witches, dragons, nymphs, and dwarfs are \u2018romantic\u2019; angels, less so. Greek gods are \u2018romantic\u2019 in Mr James Stephens or Mr Maurice Hewlett; not so in Homer and Sophocles. In this sense Malory, Boiardo, Ariosto, Spenser, Tasso, Mrs Radcliffe, Shelley, Coleridge, William Morris, and Mr E. R. Eddison are \u2018romantic\u2019 authors.<br/><br/>3. The art dealing with \u2018Titanic\u2019 characters, emotions strained beyond the common pitch, and high-flown sentiments or codes of honour is \u2018romantic\u2019. (I welcome the growing use of the word \u2018Romanesque\u2019 to describe this type.) In this sense Rostand and Sidney are \u2018romantic\u2019, and so (though unsuccessfully) are Dryden\u2019s Heroic Dramas, and there is a good deal of \u2018romanticism\u2019 in Corneille. I take it that Michelangelo is, in this sense, a \u2018romantic\u2019 artist.<br/><br/>4. \u2018Romanticism\u2019 can also mean the indulgence in abnormal, and finally in anti-natural, moods. The <i>macabre is</i> \u2018romantic\u2019, and so is an interest in torture, and a love of death. This, if I understand them, is what M. Mario Praz and M. D. de Rougemont would mean by the word. In this sense <i>Tristan</i> is Wagner\u2019s most \u2018romantic\u2019 opera; Poe, Baudelaire, and Flaubert, are \u2018romantic\u2019 authors; Surrealism is \u2018romantic\u2019.<br/><br/>5. Egoism and Subjectivism are \u2018romantic\u2019. In this sense the typically \u2018romantic\u2019 books are <i>Werther</i> and Rousseau\u2019s <i>Confessions</i>, and the works of Byron and Proust.<br/><br/>6. Every revolt against existing civilisation and conventions whether it look forward to revolution, or backward to the \u2018primitive\u2019 is called \u2018romantic\u2019 by some people. Thus pseudo-Ossian, Epstein, D. H. Lawrence, Walt Whitman, and Wagner are \u2018romantic\u2019.<br/><br/>7. Sensibility to natural objects, when solemn and enthusiastic, is \u2018romantic\u2019. In this sense <i>The Prelude</i> is the most \u2018romantic\u2019 poem in the world: and there is much \u2018romanticism\u2019 in Keats, Shelley, de Vigny, de Musset, and Goethe.<br/><br/>It will be seen, of course, that many writers are \u2018romantic\u2019 on more than one account. Thus Morris comes in my first class as well [7] as my second, Mr Eddison in my second as well as my third, Rousseau in my sixth as well as my fifth, Shelley in my sixth and fifth, and so on. This may suggest some common root, whether historical or psychological, for all seven: but the real qualitative difference between them is shown by the fact that a liking for any one does not imply liking for the others. Though people who are \u2018romantic\u2019 in different senses may turn to the same books, they turn to them for different reasons and one half of William Morris\u2019s readers do not know how the other half live. It makes all the difference in the world whether you like Shelley because he provides a mythology or because he promises a revolution. Thus I myself always loved the second kind of Romanticism and detested the fourth and fifth kinds; I liked the first very little and the third only after I was grown-up - as an acquired taste.<br/><br/>But what I meant by \u2018Romanticism\u2019 when I wrote <i>The Pilgrim\u2019s Regress</i> - and what I would still be taken to mean on the title page of this book - was not exactly any one of these seven things. What I meant was a particular recurrent experience which dominated my childhood and adolescence and which I hastily called \u2018Romantic\u2019 because inanimate nature and marvellous literature were among the things that evoked it. I still believe that the experience is common, commonly misunderstood, and of immense importance: but I know now that in other minds it arises under other <i>stimuli</i> and is entangled with other irrelevancies and that to bring it into the forefront of consciousness is not so easy as I once supposed. I will now try to describe it sufficiently to make the following pages intelligible.<br/><br/>The experience is one of intense longing. It is distinguished from other longings by two things. In the first place, though the sense of want is acute and even painful, yet the mere wanting is felt to be somehow a delight. Other desires are felt as pleasures only if satisfaction is expected in the near future: hunger is pleasant only while we know (or believe) that we are soon going to eat. But this desire, even when there is no hope of possible satisfaction, continues to be prized, and even to be preferred to anything else in the world, by those who have once felt it. This hunger is better than any other fullness; this poverty better than all other wealth. And thus it comes about, that if the desire is long absent, it may itself be desired, and that new desiring becomes a new [8] instance of the original desire, though the subject may not at once recognise the fact and thus cries out for his lost youth of soul at the very moment in which he is being rejuvenated. This sounds complicated, but it is simple when we live it. \u2018Oh to feel as I did then!\u2019 we cry; not noticing that even while we say the words the very feeling whose loss we lament is rising again in all its old bitter-sweetness. For this sweet Desire cuts across our ordinary distinctions between wanting and having. To have it is, by definition, a want: to want it, we find, is to have it.<br/><br/>In the second place, there is a peculiar mystery about the <i>object</i> of this Desire. Inexperienced people (and inattention leaves some inexperienced all their lives) suppose, when they feel it, that they know what they are desiring. Thus if it comes to a child while he is looking at a far off hillside he at once thinks \u2018if only I were there\u2019; if it comes when he is remembering some event in the past, he thinks \u2018if only I could go back to those days\u2019. If it comes (a little later) while he is reading a \u2018romantic\u2019 tale or poem of \u2018perilous seas and faerie lands forlorn\u2019, he thinks he is wishing that such places really existed and that he could reach them. If it comes (later still) in a context with erotic suggestions he believes he is desiring the perfect beloved. If he falls upon literature (like Maeterlinck or the early Yeats) which treats of spirits and the like with some show of serious belief, he may think that he is hankering for real magic and occultism. When it darts out upon him from his studies in history or science, he may confuse it with the intellectual craving for knowledge.<br/><br/>But every one of these impressions is wrong. The sole merit I claim for this book is that it is written by one who has proved them all to be wrong. There is no room for vanity in the claim: I know them to be wrong not by intelligence but by experience, such experience as would not have come my way if my youth had been wiser, more virtuous, and less self-centred than it was. For I have myself been deluded by every one of these false answers in turn, and have contemplated each of them earnestly enough to discover the cheat. To have embraced so many false Florimels is no matter for boasting: it is fools, they say, who learn by experience. But since they do at last learn, let a fool bring his experience into the common stock that wiser men may profit by it.<br/><br/>[9] Every one of these supposed <i>objects</i> for the Desire is inadequate to it. An easy experiment will show that by going to the far hillside you will get either nothing, or else a recurrence of the same desire which sent you thither. A rather more difficult, but still possible, study of your own memories, will prove that by returning to the past you could not find, as a possession, that ecstasy which some sudden reminder of the past now moves you to desire. Those remembered moments were either quite commonplace at the time (and owe all their enchantment to memory) or else were themselves moments of desiring. The same is true of the things described in the poets and marvellous romancers. The moment we endeavour to think out seriously what it would be like if they were actual, we discover this. When Sir Arthur Conan Doyle claimed to have photographed a fairy, I did not, in fact, believe it: but the mere making of the claim - the approach of the fairy to within even that hailing distance of actuality - revealed to me at once that if the claim had succeeded it would have chilled rather than satisfied the desire which fairy literature had hitherto aroused. Once grant your fairy, your enchanted forest, your satyr, faun, wood-nymph and well of immortality <i>real,</i> and amidst all the scientific, social and practical interest which the discovery would awake, the Sweet Desire would have disappeared, would have shifted its ground, like the cuckoo\u2019s voice or the rainbow\u2019s end, and be now calling us from beyond a <i>further</i> hill. With Magic in the darker sense (as it has been and is actually practised) we should fare even worse. How if one had gone that way - had actually called for something and it had come? What would one feel? Terror, pride, guilt, tingling excitement... but what would all that have to do with our Sweet Desire? It is not at Black Mass or <i>s\xe9ance</i> that the Blue Flower grows. As for the sexual answer, that I suppose to be the most obviously false Florimel of all. On whatever plane you take it, it is not what we were looking for. Lust can be gratified. Another personality can become to us \u2018our America, our New-found-land\u2019. A happy marriage can be achieved. But what has any of the three, or any mixture of the three, to do with that unnameable something, desire for which pierces us like a rapier at the smell of a bonfire, the sound of wild ducks flying overhead, the title of <i>The Well at the World\u2019s End,</i> the opening lines of <i>Kubla</i> [10] <i>Khan,</i> the morning cobwebs in late summer, or the noise of falling waves?<br/><br/>It appeared to me therefore that if a man diligently followed this desire, pursuing the false objects until their falsity appeared and then resolutely abandoning them, he must come out at last into the clear knowledge that the human soul was made to enjoy some object that is never fully given - nay, cannot even be imagined as given - in our present mode of subjective and spatio-temporal experience. This Desire was, in the soul, as the Siege Perilous in Arthur\u2019s castle - the chair in which only one could sit. And if nature makes nothing in vain, the One who can sit in this chair must exist. I knew only too well how easily the longing accepts false objects and through what dark ways the pursuit of them leads us: but I also saw that the Desire itself contains the corrective of all these errors. The only fatal error was to pretend that you had passed from desire to fruition, when, in reality, you had found either nothing, or desire itself, or the satisfaction of some different desire. The dialectic of Desire, faithfully followed, would retrieve all mistakes, head you off from all false paths, and force you not to propound, but to live through, a sort of ontological proof. This lived dialectic, and the merely argued dialectic of my philosophical progress, seemed to have converged on one goal; accordingly I tried to put them both into my allegory which thus became a defence of Romanticism (in my peculiar sense) as well as of Reason and Christianity.<br/><br/>After this explanation the reader will more easily understand (I do not ask him to condone) the bitterness of certain pages in this book. He will realise how the Post-War period must have looked to one who had followed such a road as mine. The different intellectual movements of that time were hostile to one another; but the one thing that seemed to unite them all was their common enmity to \u2018immortal longings\u2019. The direct attack carried out on them from below by those who followed Freud or D. H. Lawrence, I think I could have borne with some temper; what put me out of patience was the scorn which claimed to be from above, and which was voiced by the American \u2018Humanists\u2019, the Neo-Scholastics, and some who wrote for <i>The Criterion</i>. These people seemed to me to be condemning what they did not understand. When they called Romanticism \u2018nostalgia\u2019 I, who [11] had rejected long ago the illusion that the desired object was in the past, felt that they had not even crossed the <i>Pons Asinorum.</i> In the end I lost my temper.<br/><br/>If I were now writing a book I could bring the question between those thinkers and myself to a much finer point. One of them described Romanticism as \u2018spilled religion\u2019. I accept the description. And I agree that he who has religion ought not to spill it. But does it follow that he who finds it spilled should avert his eyes? How if there is a man to whom those bright drops on the floor are the beginning of a trail which, duly followed, will lead him in the end to taste the cup itself? How if no other trail, humanly speaking, were possible? Seen in this light my ten years\u2019 old quarrel both with the counter-Romantics on the one hand and with the sub-Romantics on the other (the apostles of instinct and even of gibberish) assumes, I trust, a certain permanent interest. Out of this double quarrel came the dominant image of my allegory - the barren, aching rocks of its \u2018North\u2019, the foetid swamps of its \u2018South\u2019, and between them the Road on which alone mankind can safely walk.<br/><br/>The things I have symbolised by North and South, which are to me equal and opposite evils, each continually strengthened and made plausible by its critique of the other, enter our experience on many different levels. In agriculture we have to fear both the barren soil and the soil which is irresistibly fertile. In the animal kingdom, the crustacean and the jellyfish represent two low solutions of the problem of existence. In our eating, the palate revolts both from excessive bitter and excessive sweet. In art, we find on the one hand, purists and doctrinaires, who would rather (like Scaliger) lose a hundred beauties than admit a single fault, and who cannot believe anything to be good if the unlearned spontaneously enjoy it: on the other hand, we find the uncritical and slovenly artists who will spoil the whole work rather than deny themselves any indulgence of sentiment or humour or sensationalism. Everyone can pick out among his own acquaintance the Northern and Southern types - the high noses, compressed lips, pale complexions, dryness and taciturnity of the one, the open mouths, the facile laughter and tears, the garrulity and (so to speak) general greasiness of the others. The Northerners are the men of rigid systems [12] whether sceptical or dogmatic, Aristocrats, Stoics, Pharisees, Rigorists, signed and sealed members of highly organised \u2018Parties\u2019. The Southerners are by their very nature less definable; boneless souls whose doors stand open day and night to almost every visitant, but always with readiest welcome for those, whether Maenad or Mystagogue, who offer some sort of intoxication. The delicious tang of the forbidden and the unknown draws them on with fatal attraction; the smudging of all frontiers, the relaxation of all resistances, dream, opium, darkness, death, and the return to the womb. Every feeling is justified by the mere fact that it is felt: for a Northerner, every feeling on the same ground is suspect. An arrogant and hasty selectiveness on some narrow <i>a priori</i> basis cuts him off from the sources of life. In Theology also there is a North and South. The one cries \u2018Drive out the bondmaid\u2019s son,\u2019 and the other \u2018Quench not the smoking flax\u2019. The one exaggerates the distinctness between Grace and Nature into a sheer opposition and by vilifying the higher levels of Nature (the real <i>praeparatio evangelica</i> inherent in certain immediately sub-Christian experiences) makes the way hard for those who are at the point of coming in. The other blurs the distinction altogether, flatters mere kindliness into thinking it is charity and vague optimisms or pantheisms into thinking that they are Faith, and makes the way out fatally easy and imperceptible for the budding apostate. The two extremes do not coincide with Romanism (to the North) and Protestantism (to the South). Barth might well have been placed among my Pale Men, and Erasmus might have found himself at home with Mr Broad.<br/><br/>I take our own age to be predominantly Northern - it is two great \u2018Northern\u2019 powers that are tearing each other to pieces on the Don while I write. But the matter is complicated, for the rigid and ruthless system of the Nazis has \u2018Southern\u2019 and swamplike elements at its centre; and when our age is \u2018Southern\u2019 at all, it is excessively so. D. H. Lawrence and the Surrealists have perhaps reached a point further \u2018South\u2019 than humanity ever reached before. And this is what one would expect. Opposite evils, far from balancing, aggravate each other. \u2018The heresies that men leave are hated most\u2019; widespread drunkenness is the father of Prohibition and Prohibition of widespread drunkenness. Nature outraged by one extreme, avenges herself by flying to the [13] other. One can even meet adult males who are not ashamed to attribute their philosophy to \u2018Reaction\u2019 and do not think the philosophy thereby discredited. <br/><br/>With both the \u2018North\u2019 and the \u2018South\u2019 a man has, I take it, only one concern - to avoid them and hold the Main Road. We must not \u2018hearken to the over-wise or to the over-foolish giant.\u2019 We were made to be neither cerebral men nor visceral men, but Men. Not beasts nor angels but Men - things at once rational and animal.<br/><br/>The fact that, if I say anything in explanation of my North and South, I have to say so much, serves to underline a rather important truth about symbols. In the present edition I have tried to make the book easier by a running headline. But I do so with great reluctance. To supply a \u2018key\u2019 to an allegory may encourage that particular misunderstanding of allegory which, as a literary critic, I have elsewhere denounced. It may encourage people to suppose that allegory is a disguise, a way of saying obscurely what could have been said more clearly. But in fact all good allegory exists not to hide but to reveal; to make the inner world more palpable by giving it an (imagined) concrete embodiment. My headline is there only because my allegory failed - partly through my own fault (I am now heartily ashamed of the preposterous allegorical filigree on p. 98), and partly because modern readers are unfamiliar with the method. But it remains true that wherever the symbols are best, the key is least adequate. For when allegory is at its best, it approaches myth, which must be grasped with the imagination, not with the intellect. If, as I still sometimes hope, my North and South and my Mr Sensible have some touch of mythical life, then no amount of \u2018explanation\u2019 will quite catch up with their meaning. It is the sort of thing you cannot learn from definition, you must rather get to know it as you get to know smell or a taste, the \u2018atmosphere\u2019 of a family or a country town, or the personality of an individual.<br/><br/>Three other cautions remain to be given. 1. The map on the end leaves has puzzled some readers because, as they say, \u2018it marks all sorts of places not mentioned in the text\u2019. But so do all maps in travel books. John\u2019s route is marked with a dotted line: those who are not interested in the places off that route need not bother about them. They are a half [14] whimsical attempt to fill in the \u2018Northern\u2019 and \u2018Southern\u2019 halves of the world with the spiritual phenomena appropriate to them. Most of the names explain themselves. <i>Wanhope</i> is Middle English for Despair; <i>Woodey</i> and <i>Lyssanesos</i> mean \u2018Isle of Insanity\u2019; <i>Behmenheim</i> is named, unfairly, after Jakob Boehme or Behmen; <i>Golnesshire</i> (Anglo-Saxon G\xe1l) is the county of Lechery; in <i>Trine</i>-land one feels \u2018in tune with the infinite\u2019; and <i>Zeitgeistheim,</i> of course, is the habitat of the <i>Zeitgeist</i> or Spirit of the Age. Naughtstow is \u2018a place that is no good at all\u2019. The two military railways were meant to symbolise the double attack from Hell on the two sides of our nature. It was hoped that the roads spreading out from each of the enemy railheads would look rather like claws or tentacles reaching out into the country of Man\u2019s Soul. If you like to put little black arrows pointing South on the seven Northern roads (in the fashion of the newspaper war maps) and others pointing North on the six Southern roads, you would get a clear picture of the Holy War as I see it. You might amuse yourself by deciding where to put them - a question that admits different answers. On the Northern front, for example, I should represent the enemy in occupation of Cruelsland and Superbia, and thus threatening the Pale Men with a pincer movement. But I don\u2019t claim to know; and doubtless the position shifts every day. 2. The name <i>Mother Kirk</i> was chosen because \u2018Christianity\u2019 is not a very convincing name. Its defect was that it not unnaturally led the reader to attribute to me a much more definite <i>Ecclesiastical</i> position than I could really boast of. The book is concerned solely with Christianity as against unbelief. \u2018Denominational\u2019 questions do not come in. 3. In this preface the autobiographical element in John has had to be stressed because the source of the obscurities lay there. But you must not assume that everything in the book is autobiographical.

The first step towards being grown up is to realize that this is balderdash.<br/><br/>Christianity isn\u2019t a hobby, or even a patent medicine. It makes statements: God exists \u2013 man is broken \u2013 God became a man \u2013 that man can mend all other men \u2013 no one else can \u2013 those who are not mended go into the dustbin. If these statements are true, they concern everyone, and are of infinite importance. If they\u2019re not, they concern nobody and are of no importance. Either zero \u2013 or infinity. Either this wire is not a live wire or else it carries a current of infinite voltage. Christianity can\u2019t be moderately important.<br/><br/>The Christian God doesn\u2019t want this or that from you: He wants you \u2013 all there is of you. It\u2019s not  unreasonable that He should. He made you. He became a man to mend you (how would you like to become a cow for several years?). He keeps you alive from moment to moment. He gives you every minute of the time you call your own. You are, in fact, His property and He wants you. There are enemies about \u2013 His enemies and yours \u2013 who also want you. If you don\u2019t belong to Him, you\u2019ll belong to them. The war between them and Him is too hot for neutrals. If you try to be a neutral you\u2019ll be invaded by the enemies.

But a small place may be very important in a war. (Stalingrad looks a small place on a map of the world.) That is why we ask you to put yourself wholly (every bit of you counts) and at once (every minute matters) on His side. Report for duty. Say your first prayer, wherever you happen to be, at once.

That meant very long days alone when my father was at work and my brother at boarding school. Alone in a big house full of books. I suppose that fixed a literary bent.

A different pattern of history will emerge from each man\u2019s history of philosophy. The trouble about skepticism is that you cannot be skeptical about everything at the same time, or you are reduced to silence.<br/><br/>(2) If truth is not objective but only personal, what is the \u201cright\u201d method of thinking in logic?<br/><br/>(3) What sort of health is possible, from this point of view, to philosophy and theology when they are separated? Such a separation would leave a concealed \u201cwaffling\u201d in metaphysics, and just naked \u201cwaffling\u201d in religion!<br/><br/>(4) How choose responsibly when you don\u2019t know to what or to whom you are responsible? On this view, why is theology not regarded as pure \u201cwaffle\u201d?<br/><br/>Professor Hodges: These questions amount to a challenge to me to state my theory of knowledge. I can do so only in outline. It is dialectical (not precisely in the Hegelian sense). All experience is a conscious relation between a subject and an object, based upon a complex of adjustments and mutual conditionings. The relation insofar as conscious can subsist only insofar as the subject <i>recognizes</i> or <i>acknowledges</i> the presence of an object, and this recognition or acknowledgement is a complex intellectual-emotional-volitional attitude which the subject can refrain from taking; in which case the object which he does not acknowledge cannot be an object for him, and his experience is to that extent the poorer. \u201cThe recognition or acceptance of a particular object or type of objects is justified in face of questioning insofar as this recognition or acceptance opens up a realm of experience, not accessible otherwise, in exploring which I continually make new discoveries, produce effects, and find things happening to me. Thus e.g.<br/><br/>(1) Acceptance of a world other than my own consciousness and conforming to the scientific principle of uniformity opens up wide realms of discovery and action. (2) Acceptance of an order of persons having claims upon me (the basic attitude underlying morality) opens up another realm in which, again, I make discoveries and find things happening to me. (3) Acceptance of the object commonly called God has analogous results. In each instance the initial acceptance opens up possibilities of continuing exploration, whose results react upon myself and build up my mind, character and life-pattern. This fruitfulness in exploration is the essence and also the test of truth.<br/><br/>In ordinary life we make our basic acceptances unconsciously and get on with our exploring. The resulting growth of knowledge is a fact of life. Socratic criticism (here epistemology) cannot destroy or alter it, but can show us how it depends on the basic acceptance, how there are alternative sets of first principles which can be used to cancel one another out, how consequently there are no bedrock certitudes. This bottomlessness is also a fact of life and we have to learn to live with it. We can even conceive the possibility of a total paralysis of thought by withdrawal of all acceptances, a depth in which, as Mr. Lewis says, only silence is possible. A serious thinker will go down again and again into that silence, but he will not stay there. He will go on living, i.e. accepting, exploring, and knowing, but with a new awareness of what he is doing, and why. He will make his acceptance responsibly - by which I simply mean seriously.<br/><br/>The choice (insofar as there is a choice) between accepting and not accepting a particular type of object or set of first principles depends on the principle of fullness of life i.e. the opening up of as many realms of experience as possible. This principle operates in determining our choice whether we are aware of it or not.<br/><br/>The above contains or implies the answers to Mr. Lewis\u2019 questions. It is he who talks of skepticism, not I. The systematic exploration of the various realms of experience is not waffling. Theology is an instance of such exploration, and so is Socratic criticism, but metaphysics is not, since it endlessly frustrates itself, and therefore it does theology no good to tie it up with metaphysics. The \u201cright\u201d way to think, which logic is to detect, is that which is fruitful in discovery. I have tried to show that the possibility of discovery depends on factors in the subject as well as in the object. It is not I who have inferred from this that no discovery is possible at all.<br/><br/>Fallacies lead to frustration in action, but right thinking does not. Evaluation is by action.<br/><br/>QUESTION: How \u201cchoose,\u201d when you don\u2019t know what are the two principles between which you choose?<br/><br/>PROFESSOR HODGES. \u201cFullness of life\u201d is the principle, but principles need not all be conscious. It is part of Socratic criticism to make them conscious. Something is at work in me which I have not chosen, i.e. myself. I ask myself, \u201cWhy do I believe so and so?\u201d and this is the fundamental passion behind philosophy as I practice it. It doesn\u2019t worry me to say that philosophy is a branch of applied psychology. I cannot calculate what experience will yield.<br/><br/>QUESTION: Is the kind of knowledge before your choice different from the knowledge after it?<br/><br/>PROFESSOR HODGES. No. Before you made a choice you were not conscious why you did it, but afterwards you know and are therefore more stable. The aim is the emergence of self\xadconsciousness. An \u201cexistential\u201d decision is one which makes you a different person, and such decisions need not be religious ones.<br/><br/>MR. LEWIS. Must I, for the sake of \u201cfullness of life,\u201d give up the only \u201cfullness of life\u201d I care about - the belief in objective truth (my unextinguishable, or rather unextinguished, passion)? Only love of objective truth could make me accept what you say.<br/><br/>PROFESSOR HODGES. I speak to you as to a Christian: certain things cannot be known \u201cin via\u201d - this we must accept.<br/><br/>QUESTION: I thought Professor Hodges was denying objective truth to metaphysics only, not, e.g., to the principles revealed by epistemology.<br/><br/>PROFESSOR HODGES: There are three levels of thought. (1) Positive or empirical enquiry, scientific and historical, where on the basis of agreed presuppositions agreed results are reached. These are objective in the sense that they hold for all thinkers who accept the principles and weigh the evidence. (2) Socratic criticism, which discloses the principles on which (1) is based, showing the extent to which they rest on foundations in the nature of the thinking subject. Such principles can be shown to have a history, but are not individual fantasies. (3) Metaphysical construction, which is individual fantasy.<br/><br/>QUESTION. Can we <i>argue</i> about fundamental choices?<br/><br/>PROFESSOR HODGES: We can sometimes show that a principle holds for all possible subjects in like circumstances, and is in that sense objective.<br/><br/>MR.

But the theory depends on an inference from usefulness to truth, of which the validity would have to be assumed. All attempts to treat thought as a natural event involve the fallacy of excluding the thought of the man making the attempt.<br/><br/>It is admitted that the mind is affected by physical events; a wireless set is influenced by atmospherics, but it does not originate its deliverances \u2014 we\u2019d take no notice of it if we thought it did. Natural events we can relate one to another until we can trace them finally to the space-time continuum. But thought has no father but thought. It is conditioned, yes, not caused. My knowledge that I have nerves is inferential.<br/><br/>The same argument applies to our values, which are affected by social factors, but if they are caused by them we cannot know that they are right. One can reject morality as an illusion, but the man who does so often tacitly excepts his own ethical motive: for instance the duty of freeing morality from superstition and of spreading enlightenment.<br/><br/>Neither Will nor Reason is the product of Nature. Therefore either I am self-existent (a belief which no one can accept) or I am a colony of some Thought and Will that are self-existent. Such reason and goodness as we can attain must be derived from a self-existent Reason and Goodness outside ourselves, in fact, a Supernatural.<br/><br/>Mr Lewis went on to say that it was often objected that the existence of the Supernatural is too important to be discernible only by abstract argument, and thus only by the leisured few. But in all other ages the plain man has accepted the findings of the mystics and the philosophers for his initial belief in the existence of the Supernatural. Today the ordinary man is forced to carry that burden himself. Either mankind has made a ghastly mistake in rejecting authority, or the power or powers ruling his destiny are making a daring experiment, and all are to become sages. A society consisting solely of plain men must end in disaster. If we are to survive we must either believe the seers or scale those heights ourselves.<br/><br/>Evidently, then, something beyond Nature exists. Man is on the border line between the Natural and the Supernatural. Material events cannot produce spiritual activity, but the latter can be responsible for many of our actions on Nature. Will and Reason cannot depend on anything but themselves, but Nature can depend on Will and Reason, or, in other words, God created Nature.<br/><br/>The relation between Nature and Supernature, which is not a relation in space and time, becomes intelligible if the Supernatural made the Natural. We even have an idea of this making, since we know the power of imagination, though we can create nothing new, but can only rearrange our material provided through sense-data. It is not inconceivable that the universe was created by an Imagination strong enough to impose phenomena on other minds.<br/><br/>It had been suggested, Mr Lewis concluded, that our ideas of making and causing are wholly derived from our experience of will. The conclusion usually drawn is that there is no making or causing, only \u201cprojection\u201d. But \u201cprojection\u201d is itself a form of causing, and it is more reasonable to suppose that Will is the only cause we know, and that therefore Will is the cause of Nature.<br/><br/>A Discussion followed. Points arising:<br/><br/>All reasoning assumes the hypothesis that inference is valid. Correct inference is self-evident.<br/><br/>\u201cRelevant\u201d (re evidence) is a rational term.<br/><br/>The universe doesn\u2019t claim to be true: it\u2019s just there.<br/><br/>Knowledge by revelation is more like empirical than rational knowledge.<br/><br/>Question: What is the criterion of truth, if you distinguish between cause and reason?<br/><br/>Mr Lewis: A mountainous country might have several maps made of it, only one of which was a true one, i.e., corresponding with the actual contours. The map drawn by Reason claims to be that true one. I couldn\u2019t get at the universe unless I could trust my reason. If we couldn\u2019t trust inference we could know nothing but our own existence. Physical reality is an inference from sensations.<br/><br/>Question: How can an axiom claim self-evidence any more than an empirical judgment on evidence?",type:"Prose",notes:["This section of the essay, which was originally read to the Socratic Society before publication in the <i>Socratic Digest,</i> is in the form of notes taken down by the Secretary of the Society.

I have tried to explain in previous talks why I think Christianity true. Here I am not trying to prove anything; only to describe what the Christian belief is. It is hoped that this may be of some use both to those who accept Christianity and to those who don\u2019t: indeed it is not much good discussing whether certain beliefs are true before we know what they are. Some listeners were offended because I used the words \u2018Christian belief\u2019 to describe the doctrines officially held by organised Christianity at nearly all times and in nearly all countries. They themselves, though claiming to be Christians, differed from this official belief on certain points, and they were annoyed because I seemed to be saying that they were therefore no Christians: and \u2018Who\u2019s he\u2019, they asked, \u2018to lay down who is a Christian and who is not?\u2019 In reality I was not attempting (in the sense they mean) to lay down anything of the sort. If anyone was asked to give an account, say, of Mohammedanism in seven very short talks he would be forced to concentrate on the general central Mohammedan tradition. He simply wouldn\u2019t have time to go into minor variations, still less to deal with the beliefs of individual Mohammedans. In his talks the word \u2018Mohammedanism\u2019 would simply <i>have</i> to be used to mean that permanent central tradition. I dealt with Christianity in the same way. I should have had to do so even if I personally did not regard the central tradition as being Chrsitianity at its truest. In point of fact I do regard it as true, and consequently I must think that those who depart from it are mistaken. Some people say this attitude is \u2018intolerant\u2019. \u2018He\u2019s the sort of man\u2019, they complain, \u2018who thinks his own [6] beliefs are true and everyone else\u2019s are wrong.\u2019 But after all how can any man help doing that? A man must think his own belief true because if he didn\u2019t it would not be his belief. \u2018Your belief\u2019 <i>means</i> \u2018what you think true\u2019. And if you think one thing true, of course you must think the opposite false. But this is a very different thing from saying that those who hold the opposite belief are necessarily bad or stupid. There is a deeper sense of the word \u2018Christian\u2019 in which some who hold wrong beliefs may be more Christian than some who hold the right ones. Christ, who can see into their hearts, may recognise them as His own, and more His own than many of the orthodox. Needless to say, I never dreamed of laying down who was a \u2018Christian\u2019 in that sense. It would have been the grossest impudence for me even to raise the question, for neither I nor any mortal can possibly know the answer.<br/><br/>April 15th, 1944<br/>C.S.

I don\u2019t remember the names of most of the others, though their faces, and indeed the whole scene, come back to me very clearly: specially Gordon himself, leonine and tolerant, at the head of the table looking very much less alert than he actually was. It was work that exactly suited him \u2212 to seem to be doing nothing and yet actually to guide the whole debate. He said surprisingly little: it was only afterwards one realized how his <i>exiguum clinamen</i> had, at several points, headed us all off from some blind alley, or how a few unemphatic words of apparent agreement had turned a half truth into a whole one and tacitly suppressed an error. It never crossed our minds that the papers we read and the arguments we had about them could be less interesting, novel and momentous to him than they were to us. This was partly, no doubt, because he had a real sympathy with youth: still more, as I now realize, because he was doing his job so well that we never saw it was a \u201cjob\u201d at all.

Who, one might ask, is this Anglican layman, translated and introduced by Catholics, who, on the frontispiece of <i><The Screwtape Letters,/i> brings together a quotation from Sir Thomas More and one from Martin Luther? Is he unaware of the differences between Christians, or does he consider them unimportant? By no means. As a Christian, I am very much aware that our divisions grieve the Holy Spirit and hold back the work of Christ; as a logician I realize that when two churches affirm opposing positions, these cannot be reconciled. But because I was an unbeliever for a long time, I perceived something which perhaps those brought up in the Church do not see. Even when I feared and detested Christianity, I was struck by its essential unity, which, in spite of its divisions, it has never lost. I trembled on recognizing the same unmistakable aroma coming from the writings of Dante and Bunyan, Thomas Aquinas and William Law. Since my conversion, it has seemed my particular task to tell the outside world what all Christians believe. Controversy I leave to others: that is the business of theologians. I think that you and I, the laity, simple soldiers of the Faith, will best serve the cause of reconciliation not so much by contributing to such debates, but by our prayers, and by sharing all that can already be shared of Christian life. If the unity of charity and intention between us were strong enough, perhaps our doctrinal differences would be resolved sooner; without that spiritual unity, a doctrinal agreement between our religious leaders would be sterile. In the meantime, it will be apparent that the man who is most faithful in living the Christian life in his own church is spiritually the closest to the faithful believers in other confessions: because the geography of the spiritual world is very different from that of the physical world. In the latter, countries touch each other at their borders, in the former, at their centre.

The idea of disturbing its repose in the grave now comes from its publishers, not from me, but I have a reason for wishing to be present at the exhumation. Nearly a quarter of a century has gone since I wrote it, and in that time things have changed both within me and round me; my old poem might be misunderstood by those who now read it for the first time.<br/><br/>I am told that the Persian poets draw a distinction between poetry which they have \u2018found\u2019 and poetry which they have \u2018brought\u2019: if you like, between the given and the invented, though they wisely refuse to identify this with the distinction between good and bad. Their terminology applies with unusual clarity to my poem. What I \u2018found\u2019, what simply \u2018came to me\u2019, was the story of a man who, on some mysterious bride, begets a monster: which monster, as soon as it has killed its father, becomes a god. This story arrived, complete, in my mind somewhere about my seventeenth year. To the best of my knowledge I did not consciously or voluntarily invent it, nor was it, in the plain sense of that word, a dream. All I know about it is that there was a time when it was not there, and then presently a time when it was. Every one may allegorise it or psychoanalyse it as he pleases: and if I did so myself my interpretations would have no more authority than anyone else\u2019s.<br/><br/>The Platonic and totalitarian state from which Dymer escapes in Canto I was a natural invention for one who detested the state in Plato\u2019s <i>Republic</i> as much as he liked everything else in Plato, and who was, by temperament, an extreme anarchist. I put into it my hatred of my public school and my recent hatred of the army. But I was already critical of my own anarchism. There had been a time when the sense of defiant and almost drunken liberation which fills the first two acts of <i>Siegfried</i> had completely satisfied me. Now, I thought, I knew better. My hero therefore must go through his Siegfried moment in Cantos I and II and find in Canto IV what really comes of that mood in the end. For it seemed to me that two opposite forces in man tended equally to revolt. The one criticises and at need defies civilisation because it is not good enough, the other stabs it from below and behind because it is already too good for total baseness to endure. The hero who dethrones a tyrant will therefore be first feted and afterwards murdered by the rabble who feel a disinterested hatred of order and reason as such. Hence, in Canto IV, Bran\u2019s revolt which at once parodies and punishes Dymer\u2019s. It will be remembered that, when I wrote, the first horrors of the Russian Revolution were still fresh in every one\u2019s mind; and in my own country, Ulster, we had had opportunities of observing the daemonic character of popular political \u2018causes\u2019.<br/><br/>In those days the new psychology was just beginning to make itself felt in the circles I most frequented at Oxford. This joined forces with the fact that we felt ourselves (as young men always do) to be escaping from the illusions of adolescence, and as a result we were much exercised about the problem of fantasy or wishful thinking. The \u2018Christina Dream\u2019; as we called it (after Christina Pontifex in Butler\u2019s novel), was the hidden enemy whom we were all determined to unmask and defeat. My hero, therefore, had to be a man who had succumbed to its allurements and finally got the better of them. But the particular form in which this was worked out depended on two peculiarities of my own history.<br/><br/>(1) From at least the age of six, romantic longing \u2013 <i>Sehnsucht</i> - had played an unusually central part in my experience. Such longing is in itself the very reverse of wishful thinking: it is more like thoughtful wishing. But it throws off what may be called systems of imagery. One among many such which it had thrown off for me was the Hesperian or Western Garden system, mainly derived from Euripides, Milton, Morris, and the early Yeats. By the time I wrote <i>Dymer</i> I had come, under the influence of our common obsession about Christina Dreams, into a state of angry revolt against that spell. I regarded it as the very type of the illusions I was trying to escape from. It must therefore be savagely attacked. Dymer\u2019s temptation to relapse into the world of fantasy therefore comes to him (Canto VII) in that form. All through that canto I am cutting down my own former \u2018groves and high places\u2019 and biting the hand that had fed me. I even tried to get the sneer into the metre; the archaic spelling and accentuation of <i>countrie</i> in vii. 23 is meant as parody. In all this, as I now believe, I was mistaken. Instead of repenting my idolatry I spat upon the images which only my own misunderstanding greed had ever made into idols. But \u2018the heresies that men leave are hated most\u2019 and lovers\u2019 quarrels can be the bitterest of all.<br/><br/>(2) Several years before I wrote the poem, back in my teens, when my mind, except for a vigilant rejection of Christianity, had no fixed principles, and everything from strict materialism to theosophy could find by turns an entry, I had been, as boys are, temporarily attracted to what was then called \u2018the Occult\u2019. I blundered into it innocently enough. In those days every one was reading Maeterlinck, and I wanted to improve my French. Moreover, from Yeats\u2019s early poetry it was natural to turn to his prose; and there I found to my astonishment that Yeats, unlike other romantic poets, really and literally believed in the sort of beings he put into his poems. There was no question here of \u2018symbolism\u2019: he believed in magic. And so for a time <i>Rosa Alchemica</i> took its turn (along with Voltaire, Lucretius, and Joseph McCabe) among my serious books. You will understand that this period had ended a long time (years are longer at that age) before I set about writing <i>Dymer</i>. By then, so far as I was anything, I was an idealist, and for an idealist all supernaturalisms were equally illusions, all \u2018spirits\u2019 merely symbols of \u2018Spirit\u2019 in the metaphysical sense, futile and dangerous if mistaken for facts. I put this into vii. 8. I was now quite sure that magic or spiritism of any kind was a fantasy and of all fantasies the worst. But this wholesome conviction had recently been inflamed into a violent antipathy. It had happened to me to see a man, and a man whom I loved, sink into screaming mania and finally into death under the influence, as I believed, of spiritualism. And I had also been twice admitted to the upper room in Yeats\u2019s own house in Broad Street. His conversation turned much on magic. I was overawed by his personality, and by his doctrine half fascinated and half repelled because of the fascination.<br/><br/>The angel in the last canto does not of course mean that I had any Christian beliefs when I wrote the poem, any more (<i>si parva licet componere magnis</i>) than the conclusion of <i>Faust,</i> Part II, means that Goethe was a believer.<br/><br/>This, I think, explains all that the reader might want explained in my narrative. My hero was to be a man escaping from illusion. He begins by egregiously supposing the universe to be his friend and seems for a time to find confirmation of his belief. Then he tries, as we all try, to repeat his moment of youthful rapture. It cannot be done; the old Matriarch sees to that. On top of this rebuff comes the discovery of the consequences which his rebellion against the City has produced. He sinks into despair and gives utterance to the pessimism which had, on the whole, been my own view about six years earlier. Hunger and a shock of real danger bring him to his senses and he at last accepts reality. But just as he is setting out on the new and soberer life, the shabbiest of all brides is offered him; the false promise that by magic or invited illusion there may be a short cut back to the one happiness he remembers. He relapses and swallows the bait, but he has grown too mature to be really deceived. He finds that the wish-fulfilment dream leads to the fear-fulfilment dream, recovers himself, defies the Magician who tempted him, and faces his destiny.<br/><br/>The physical appearance of the Magician in vi. 6-9 owes something to Yeats as I saw him. If he were now alive I would ask his pardon with shame for having repaid his hospitality by such freedom. It was not done in malice, and the likeness is not, I think, in itself, uncomplimentary.<br/><br/>Since his great name here comes before us, let me take the opportunity of saluting his genius: a genius so potent that, having first revivified and transmuted that romantic tradition which he found almost on its deathbed (and invented a new kind of blank verse in the process), he could then go on to weather one of the bitterest literary revolutions we have known, embark on a second career, and, as it were with one hand, play most of the moderns off the field at their own game. If there is, as may be thought, a pride verging on insolence in his later work, such pride has never come so near to being excusable. It must have been difficult for him to respect either the mere Romantics who could only bewail a lost leader or the mere moderns who could see no difference between <i>On Baile\u2019s Strand</i> and the work of Richard le Gallienne.<br/><br/>Some may be surprised at the strength of the anti-totalitarian feeling in a poem written so long ago. I had not read <i>Brave New World</i> or <i>Land Under England</i> or <i>The Aerodrome</i>: nor had we yet tasted the fruits of a planned economy in our own lives.

They mostly represented him in a ludicrous light. This might be misunderstood by one who did not know the habits of the English male. Our relations to him were like those of boys to a master who is always ridiculed behind his back, not although, but because, he is both loved and feared.<br/><br/>\u2018He was regarded by at least one of his junior colleagues (not me) as an inveterate romancer. I am sure myself that all his stories were intended to be strictly true, but possibly had unconsciously been moulded by a mixture of memory and imagination.<br/><br/>\u2018He said to me in serious conversation: \u201cI once met a man who said he could not understand Indians because an Indian had said to him that God might be represented as an elephant. Now, though I fully understand the reasons for anthropomorphism in art, I myself have always found an elephant the most natural symbol.\u201d<br/><br/>\u2018He had kinds of knowledge that one would not have suspected. Years ago some illustrated paper published a reproduction of a supposedly Diabolist picture of the Annunciation. Most of us said we could see nothing wrong in it. Benecke (in a low voice): \u201cLook at that hand.\u201d We: \u201cWhy, what does that mean?\u201d Benecke (with a contraction of his lip and forehead suggesting actual physical pain): \u201cOh, something very bad indeed.\u201d He made it clear that the subject was now closed.<br/><br/>\u2018He could, especially in his later years, be extremely formidable. This side of him cannot be represented in writing because what counted was not the words he said but the look in his face.<br/><br/>\u2018It was almost impossible to make Benecke recognise one\u2019s ignorance of anything he happened to be talking about. He and I usually came out of chapel together and went to breakfast in the Common Room. He would stand by the fire reading the morning paper and presently announce in a low voice: \u201cI see Mrs. X. is dead.\u201d I would reply: \u201cMrs. X? I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t know her.\u201d \u201cOh!\u201d he would say (with some severity), \u201csurely you didn\u2019t think I meant Mrs Norman X?<br/><br/>\u2018Often Benecke, J.A. Smith, J.T. Christie and I breakfasted together. Christie said: \u201cThe conversation of J.A. and Benecke is like what Ouida\u2019s idea of donnish conversation would be, e.g. J.A.: \u2018Benecke, what do you regard as the Vocative of Cleisthenes?\u2019 P.V.M.B. (demurely): \u2018Well, it depends on which Cleisthenes you mean.\u2019 J.A. (with deep indignation): \u2018Oh Cleisthenes of Trebizond of course.\u2019 They irritated each other a little.\u201d<br/><br/>\u2018Benecke had a clerical friend who used to come and pay him longer visits than were quite welcome. As Benecke generally came to breakfast a little earlier than his guest, I could tell from the way in which he spoke of him how his feelings were progressing. On the second morning he would refer to him as \u201cmy guest X.\u201d On the third he had become \u201cthe Vicar of Z.\u201d But on one occasion the visit lasted so long that Benecke referred to him as \u201cthe distinguished subject of our previous conversation.\u201d<br/><br/>\u2018Benecke was a teetotaller when I knew him, but remarked: \u201cIf I were tempted to drink too much of anything it would be brandy. I always picture Nectar as brandy when I read about it in poetry.\u201d<br/><br/>He told me that when he first visited Berlin as a young man there was no recognised dinner hour. He called on some of his relatives at 12 o\u2019clock and to his horror was received with the words: \u201cAch! There is the young Paul from England who has so friendly himself to dinner invited.\u201d After a very heavy meal he left the house and decided that a longish walk was what he needed. This brought him at about 6 o\u2019clock to a neighborhood in the suburbs where he remembered that he had some other relatives he ought to call on. No sooner had he been shown in that he received exactly the same greeting and found himself sitting down to another and even larger dinner.<br/><br/>\u2018The state of his clothes, and especially his collars, often went beyond all ordinary limits of donnish shabbiness. Someone advanced the hypothesis that personal vanity (he was extremely, classically handsome) had been a temptation of his youth and that he had been mortifying it ever  since. But I think he was wholly unconscious of his clothes. There was a story of new collars being smuggled into his chambers by the connivance of his scout and the benevolence of a colleague, and he is said not to have noticed.<br/><br/>\u2018Benecke had a most insensitive skin: so insensitive that he said he regarded a mustard plaster as a pleasure because it gave him traces of sensation on the surface of his body where he usually had none. On one occasion within my memory he stood in front of the Common Room fire till two holes were burnt right through his trousers on each calf, and went away unconscious of the fact. It was discovered by his colleagues only because he went about for some days with a white patch on each calf which we at first supposed to be a stain of flour or whitewash. It was really his underclothes showing through the holes in his trouser legs.\u2019",type:"Prose",notes:null},{title:"Preface to <i>English Literature in the Sixteenth Century Excluding Drama</i>",printedIn:"<i>English Literature in the Sixteenth Century Excluding Drama</i> (Oxford: Oxford University Press)",issueOrVolume:null,pageRange:"v-vi",year:1954,monthAndDay:null,textProvided:"When I began this book I had the idea \u2013 perhaps most literary historians have \u2013 of giving each author space in proportion to the value I set on him; but I found it would not do.

Bad books may be of importance for the history of taste and if they are passed over too briefly the student\u2019s picture of a period may be distorted.

Lewis, in his most mischievous mood, proved irresistible this morning when he delivered to the conference of classical teachers here a withering attack on modern translations of the classics. They apparently sprang, he declared, from \u201ca very real hatred\u201d of what most poetry, other than that of relatively recent times, has been.<br/><br/>Surveying, with acid asides, the great change he had seen during his lifetime, he admitted so little sympathy for the new idea that a translation should try to be \u201cwhat the author would have written if he had lived in our own day.\u201d What reason had we to suppose that Virgil, for instance, would have written anything at all or, if he did, would have got anywhere with it? Our age, with implacable hostility, would have known how to deal with him.<br/><br/><div style='text-align: center'>TWO CARDINAL SINS</div><br/>The present view seemed to be that ours were the only possible poetics, Professor Lewis observed; and that the old poets really must have conformed to them, however little they might appear to have done\u2014and if they did not they must be made to do so. He singled out the opinions and Homeric translations of W. H. D. Rouse as his main target, though neither T. E. Lawrence nor Professor C. Day Lewis escaped wholly unscathed. (Of Dr. E. V. Rieu he would only say with a smile: \u201cRieu\u2019s daughter was a pupil of mine and I have met him and liked them both very much.\u201d)<br/><br/>Why, he demanded, was the Rousean view so widely held? He found much of the answer in the fact that the two cardinal sins to-day were archaisms and poetic diction. \u201cI have seen strong young men almost turn pale at the use of an archaism.\u201d With few exceptions all the poetry written in the past was now assumed to be \u201cbunk\u201d; poetry began with Mr. Eliot and Mr. Pound.

He confessed he had found the same deplorable point of view in his own field. You were always discovering that some work the world had enjoyed for 300, 500, or 800 years was not what had been thought, but bore an extremely close resemblance to <i>The Outsider</i> or the like.<br/><br/>It was almost, he complained, as if there were a set of people who did not want the modern man to know there had once been a language different from our own. The age had to be carefully guarded, cut off from any subversive influence that might creep in from the poetry of the past.<br/><br/>Professor Lewis did not subscribe either to the theory that translations should try to recreate the impression the originals gave to their contemporaries. In this case we were not dealing with a snark or a boojum, but how could we know what any poem sounded like to its contemporaries? The only safe way was to seek as closely as possible the effect it would give a reader if he was really a tiptop, modern, classical scholar. Even so he gave warning against making the classics sound too English: \u201cYou don\u2019t go to France to get tea, do you?\u201d<br/><br/><div style='text-align: center'>MORAL LESSON</div><br/>We all knew he was a moralist, Professor Lewis cheerfully concluded, and he would be very sorry to end without drawing a useful moral lesson.

I hope they did not hasten its death, but they certainly lost it one reader. A country clergyman wrote to the editor, withdrawing his subscription on the ground that \u201cmuch of the advice given in these letters seemed to him not only erroneous but positively diabolical.\u201d<br/><br/>In general, however, they had a reception I had never dreamed of. Reviews were either laudatory or filled with that sort of anger which tells an author that he has hit his target; sales were at first (by my standards) prodigious, and have continued steady.<br/><br/>Of course, sales do not always mean what authors hope. If you gauged the amount of Bible reading in England by the number of Bibles sold, you would go far astray. Sales of <i>The Screwtape Letters,</i> in their own little way, suffer from a similar ambiguity. It is the sort of book that gets given to godchildren, the sort that gets read aloud at retreats. It is even, as I have noticed with a chastened smile, the sort that gravitates towards spare bedrooms, there to live a life of undisturbed tranquillity in company with <i>The Road Mender, John Inglesant,</i> and <i>The Life of the Bee.</i> Sometimes it is bought for even more humiliating reasons. A lady whom I knew discovered that the pretty little probationer who filled her hot-water bottle in the hospital had read <i>Screwtape.</i> She also discovered why.<br/><br/>\u201cYou see,\u201d said the girl, \u201cwe were warned that at interviews, after the real, technical questions are over, matrons and people sometimes ask about your general interests. The best thing is to say you\u2019ve read something. So they gave us a list of about ten books that usually go down pretty well and said we ought to read at least one of them.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cAnd you chose <i>Screwtape</i>?\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cWell, of course; it was the shortest.\u201d<br/><br/>Still, when all allowances have been made, the book has had readers of the genuine sort sufficiently numerous to make it worthwhile answering some of the questions it has raised in their minds.<br/><br/>The commonest question is whether I really \u201cbelieve in the Devil.\u201d<br/><br/>Now, if by \u201cthe Devil\u201d you mean a power opposite to God and, like God, self-existent from all eternity, the answer is certainly No. There is no uncreated being except God. God has no opposite. No being could attain a \u201cperfect badness\u201d opposite to the perfect goodness of God; for when you have taken away every kind of good thing (intelligence, will, memory, energy, and existence itself) there would be none of him left.<br/><br/>The proper question is whether I believe in devils. I do. That is to say, I believe in angels, and I believe that some of these, by the abuse of their free will, have become enemies to God and, as a corollary, to us. These we may call devils. They do not differ in nature from good angels, but their nature is depraved. <i>Devil</i> is the opposite of <i>angel</i> only as Bad Man is the opposite of Good Man. Satan, the leader or dictator of devils, is the opposite, not of God, but of Michael.<br/><br/>I believe this not in the sense that it is part of my creed, but in the sense that it is one of my opinions. My religion would not be in ruins if this opinion were shown to be false. Till that happens \u2013 and proofs of a negative are hard to come by \u2013 I shall retain it. It seems to me to explain a good many facts. It agrees with the plain sense of Scripture, the tradition of Christendom, and the beliefs of most men at most times. And it conflicts with nothing that any of the sciences has shown to be true.<br/><br/>It should be (but it is not) unnecessary to add that a belief in angels, whether good or evil, does not mean a belief in either as they are represented in art and literature. Devils are depicted with bats\u2019 wings and good angels with birds\u2019 wings, not because anyone holds that moral deterioration would be likely to turn feathers into membrane, but because most men like birds better than bats. They are given wings at all in order to suggest the swiftness of unimpeded intellectual energy. They are given human form because man is the only rational creature we know. Creatures higher in the natural order than ourselves, either incorporeal or animating bodies of a sort we cannot experience, must be represented symbolically if they are to be represented at all.<br/><br/>These forms are not only symbolical but were always known to be symbolical by reflective people. The Greeks did not believe that the gods were really like the beautiful human shapes their sculptors gave them. In their poetry a god who wishes to \u201cappear\u201d to a mortal temporarily assumes the likeness of a man. Christian theology has nearly always explained the \u201cappearance\u201d of an angel in the same way. It is only the ignorant, said Dionysius in the fifth century, who dream that spirits are really winged men.<br/><br/>In the plastic arts these symbols have steadily degenerated. Fra Angelico\u2019s angels carry in their face and gesture the peace and authority of Heaven. Later come the chubby infantile nudes of Raphael; finally the soft, slim, girlish, and consolatory angels of nineteenth century art, shapes so feminine that they avoid being voluptuous only by their total insipidity \u2013 the frigid houris of a teatable paradise. They are a pernicious symbol. In Scripture the visitation of an angel is always alarming; it has to begin by saying \u201cFear not.\u201d The Victorian angel looks as if it were going to say, \u201cThere, there.\u201d<br/><br/>The literary symbols are more dangerous because they are not so easily recognised as symbolical. Those of Dante are the best. Before his angels we sink in awe. His devils, as Ruskin rightly remarked, in their rage, spite, and obscenity, are far more like what the reality must be than anything in Milton. Milton\u2019s devils, by their grandeur and high poetry, have done great harm, and his angels owe too much to Homer and Raphael. But the really pernicious image is Goethe\u2019s Mephistopheles. It is Faust, not he, who really exhibits the ruthless, sleepless, unsmiling concentration upon self which is the mark of Hell. The humorous, civilised, sensible, adaptable Mephistopheles has helped to strengthen the illusion that evil is liberating.<br/><br/>A little man may sometimes avoid some single error made by a great one, and I was determined that my own symbolism should at least not err in Goethe\u2019s way. For humor involves a sense of proportion and a power of seeing yourself from the outside. Whatever else we attribute to beings who sinned through pride, we must not attribute this. Satan, said Chesterton, fell through force of gravity. We must picture Hell as a state where everyone is perpetually concerned about his own dignity and advancement, where everyone has a grievance, and where everyone lives the deadly serious passions of envy, self-importance, and resentment. This, to begin with. For the rest, my own choice of symbols depended, I suppose, on temperament and on the age.<br/><br/>I like bats much better than bureaucrats. I live in the Managerial Age, in a world of \u201cAdmin.\u201d The greatest evil is not now done in those sordid \u201cdens of crime\u201d that Dickens loved to paint. It is not done even in concentration camps and labour camps. In those we see its final result. But it is conceived and ordered (moved, seconded, carried, and minuted) in clean, carpeted, warmed, and well-lighted offices, by quiet men with white collars and cut fingernails and smooth-shaven cheeks who do not need to raise their voice. Hence, naturally enough, my symbol for Hell is something like the bureaucracy of a police state or the offices of a thoroughly nasty business concern.<br/><br/>Milton has told us that \u201cdevil with devil damned Firm concord holds.\u201d But how? Certainly not by friendship. A being which can still love is not yet a devil. Here again my symbol seemed to me useful. It enabled me, by earthly parallels, to picture an official society held together entirely by fear and greed. On the surface, manners are normally suave. Rudeness to one\u2019s superiors would obviously be suicidal; rudeness to one\u2019s equals might put them on their guard before you were ready to spring your mine. For of course \u201cDog eat dog\u201d is the principle of the whole organisation. Everyone wishes everyone else\u2019s discrediting, demotion, and ruin; everyone is an expert in the confidential report, the pretended alliance, the stab in the back. Over all this their good manners, their expressions of grave respect, their \u201ctributes\u201d to one another\u2019s invaluable services form a thin crust. Every now and then it gets punctured, and the scalding lava of their hatred spurts out.<br/><br/>This symbol also enabled me to get rid of the absurd fancy that devils are engaged in the disinterested pursuit of something called Evil (the capital is essential). Mine have no use for any such turnip ghost. Bad angels, like bad men, are entirely practical. They have two motives. The first is fear of punishment: for as totalitarian countries have their camps for torture, so my Hell contains deeper Hells, its \u201chouses of correction.\u201d Their second motive is a kind of hunger. I feign that devils can, in a spiritual sense, eat one another; and us. Even in human life we have seen the passion to dominate, almost to digest, one\u2019s fellow; to make his whole intellectual and emotional life merely an extension of one\u2019s own \u2013 to hate one\u2019s hatreds and resent one\u2019s grievances and indulge one\u2019s egoism through him as well as through oneself. His own little store of passion must of course be suppressed to make room for ours. If he resists this suppression he is being very selfish.<br/><br/>On Earth this desire is often called \u201clove.\u201d In Hell I feign that they recognise it as hunger. But there the hunger is more ravenous, and a fuller satisfaction is possible. There, I suggest, the stronger spirit \u2013 there are perhaps no bodies to impede the tion \u2013 can really and irrevocably suck the weaker into itself and permanently gorge its own being on the weaker\u2019s outraged individuality. It is (I feign) for this that devils desire human souls and the souls of one another. It is for this that Satan desires all his own followers and all the sons of Eve and all the host of Heaven. His dream is of the day when all shall be inside him and all that says \u201cI\u201d can say it only through him. This, I surmise, is the bloated-spider parody, the only imitation he can understand, of that unfathomed bounty whereby God turns tools into servants and servants into sons, so that they may be at last reunited to Him in the perfect freedom of a love offered from the height of the utter individualities which he has liberated them to be.<br/><br/>But, as in Grimm\u2019s story, <i>des tr\xe4umte mir nur,</i> this is all only myth and symbol. That is why the question of my own opinion about devils, though proper to be answered when once it was raised, is really of very minor importance for a reader of <i>Screwtape.</i> To those who share that opinion, my devils will be symbols of a concrete reality: to others, they will be personifications of abstractions, and the book will be an allegory. But it makes little difference which way you read it. For of course its purpose was not to speculate about diabolical life but to throw light from a new angle on the life of men.<br/><br/>I am told that I was not first in the field and that someone in the seventeenth century wrote letters from a devil. I have not seen that book. I believe its slant was mainly political. But I gladly acknowledge a debt to Stephen McKenna\u2019s <i>The Confessions of a Well-Meaning Woman.</i> The connection may not be obvious, but you will find there the same moral inversion \u2013 the blacks all white and the whites all black  \u2013 and the humour which comes of speaking through a totally humourless <i>persona.</i> I think my idea of spiritual cannibalism probably owes something to the horrible scenes of \u201cabsorbing\u201d in David Lindsay\u2019s neglected <i>Voyage to Arcturus.</i><br/><br/>The names of my devils have excited a good deal of curiosity, and there have been many explanations, all wrong. The truth is that I aimed merely at making them nasty \u2013 and here too I am perhaps indebted to Lindsay \u2013 by the sound. Once a name was invented, I might speculate like anyone else (and with no more authority than anyone else) as to the phonetic associations which caused the unpleasant effect. I fancy that <i>Scrooge, screw, thumbscrew, tapeworm,</i> and <i>red tape</i> all do some work in my hero\u2019s name, and that <i>slob, slobber, slubber</i>, and <i>gob</i> have all gone into <i>slubgob.</i><br/><br/>Some have paid me an undeserved compliment by supposing that my <i>Letters</i> were the ripe fruit of many years\u2019 study in moral and ascetic theology. They forgot that there is an equally reliable, though less creditable, way of learning how temptation works. \u201cMy heart\u201d \u2013 I need no other\u2019s  \u2013  \u201cshoweth me the wickedness of the ungodly.\u201d<br/><br/>I was often asked or advised to add to the original <i>Letters,</i> but for many years I felt not the least inclination to do it. Though I had never written anything more easily, I never wrote with less enjoyment. The ease came, no doubt, from the fact that the device of diabolical letters, once you have thought of it, exploits itself spontaneously, like Swift\u2019s big and little men, or the medical and ethical philosophy of <i>Erewhon,</i> or Anstey\u2019s <i>Garuda Stone.</i> It would run away with you for a thousand pages if you gave it its head. But though it was easy to twist one\u2019s mind into the diabolical attitude, it was not fun, or not for long. The strain produced a sort of spiritual cramp. The work into which I had to project myself while I spoke through Screwtape was all dust, grit, thirst, and itch. Every trace of beauty, freshness, and geniality had to be excluded. It almost smothered me before I was done. It would have smothered my readers if I had prolonged it.<br/><br/>I had, moreover, a sort of grudge against my book for not being a different book which no one could write. Ideally, Screwtape advice to Wormwood should have been balanced by archangelical advice to the patient\u2019s guardian angel. Without this the picture of human life is lopsided. But who could supply the deficiency? Even if a man \u2013 and he would have to be a far better man than I \u2013 could scale the spiritual heights required, what \u201canswerable style\u201d could he use? For the style would really be part of the content. Mere advice would be no good; every sentence would have to smell of Heaven. And nowadays even if you could write a prose like Traherne\u2019s, you wouldn\u2019t be allowed to, for the canon of \u201cfunctionalism\u201d has disabled literature for half its functions. (At bottom, every ideal of style dictates not only how we should say things but what sort of things we may say.)<br/><br/>Then, as years went on and the stifling experience of writing the <i>Letters</i> became a weaker memory, reflections on this and that which seemed somehow to demand Screwtapian treatment began to occur to me. I was resolved never to write another <i>Letter.</i> The idea of something like a lecture or \u201caddress\u201d hovered vaguely in my mind, now forgotten, now recalled, never written. Then came an invitation from the <i>Saturday Evening Post,</i> and that pressed the trigger.<br/><br/>[In 1962 the text was signed and dated:]<br/>C.S.

His early lyrics contained perhaps his most unique contribution to the literature of the period, but \u201cJason\u201d & the \u201cEarthly Paradise\u201d, were the works of his maturity and probably destined to enjoy the greater popularity. As a teller of tales he yielded to none except Homer. In his prose works he had endeavoured, with some success, to recall the melody and charm of Malory.<br/><br/>After the interval the usual informal discussion followed. The general sense of the Society was that rather too high a position had been claimed for William Morris. Dr. Carlyle  observed that in his early lyrical work Morris had probably been writing in a style which was not really natural to him under the influence of Rossetti. Other members commented on the lack of original thought and \u201chigh seriousness\u201d in the poet\u2019s work. The Society then adjourned after fixing the place of its next meeting. <br/><br/> [14 June 1919:]<br/><br/>The Society thanked Mr. Hartman for his enthusiastic and sympathetic criticism, and after the interval discussed the theory of realism \u2013 the discussion soon passing, by paths which the present writer at least has never been able to retrace, into the metaphysical question of \u201cabstract values\u201d. Mr. Pasley  was adamantine in refusing to allow more than subjective reality to merit in any sphere whatsoever. The meeting then adjourned, after Mr. Watling  had endeavoured to carry a rule that the patrons of the subjective theory should in future be compelled to insert the words TO ME after every adjective they had occasion to use. <br/><br/>[According to Hooper, \u201cAdded sometime later are the words:\u201d]<br/><br/>Without success.",type:"Prose",notes:null},{title:"Fragment of a story beginning \u201cIt was in autumn\u201d",printedIn:"Walter Hooper, \u201cPast Watchful Dragons: The Fairy Tales of C.S.

He was a tall, straight sort of a man, severe in his dress and in his expression. I have been told he was handsome in his youth, and his beard, when I knew him, did not conceal a certain cold and heavy regularity of features which might have been admired if you could forgive them for their lack of all that makes a face alive. \u2018There was no speculation in his eyes\u2019 \u2212 the face, like the man, was timid, prim, sour, at once oppressed and oppressive. He was a harsh husband and a despotic father. His wife was \u2018in tears half the time\u2019 while he lived, as one of his sons told me. He died of anaemia. In his declining years his habits became very gross, and I have heard that he commonly broke wind without restraint in the presence of his wife and children. My own father described his funeral as \u2018the most cheerful funeral he ever attended\u2019.<br/><br/>Outside his own house, he was civil and even friendly, as far as his powers would let him be. He had however no conversation. Even on religious subjects he was a deadweight, and my father thought his knowledge of Scripture by no means extensive. I have heard that at [17] family prayers in his own house, where he daily read and then expounded a passage from the Bible, he went over and over the same passages and gave always the same explanations. His chief intellectual interests were those of an antiquary, and he had on his shelves a few volumes of local history and archaeology. It is also worth recording that his was the only private house in which I have ever seen a copy of Alison\u2019s <i>French Revolution,</i> a work endlessly familiar in the secondhand bookshops of my day. He was also a sportsman, and sometimes went shooting on the islands of Strangford Lough.<br/><br/>His wife had unmistakably been a beauty in her youth, and was a comely matron when I first remember her. Her character is not easy to describe. I think it changed a good deal during the period of my acquaintance with her. Her sincere and almost motherly affection for myself was however the same at the end as at the beginning. This perhaps gave the key to one side of her nature. She was (at first sight \u2212 or shall I say, at certain periods) the very type of the simple, warm hearted, confiding wife and mother. \u2018All was conscience and tendre herte.\u2019 Such was her naivete that she would pour out to any acquaintance met on the road, the whole plot of the last novel she had read: and her comments on her neighbours were of such a kind that one was left wondering whether quite that amount of simplicity was possible. Could it be that the sheep\u2019s clothing concealed a cat? Yet no sooner had you veered towards this hypothesis, than the next remark would fling you back on the original view \u2212 \u2018naivete, not to say mental deficiency\u2019. Succeeding years tended to bring the truth to light, that Mrs Greeves had, with all her benevolence, a genuine streak of ill nature in her. Her unfair and partial treatment of her son John, when I last stayed in Bernagh, is the heaviest count against her. And yet, like Chaucer, \u2018me ne list this silly woman chide\u2019, for silly she was and sillier she steadily became.<br/><br/>Her chief reading after her husband\u2019s death, was such books as prophesy the end of the world. One of them, I remember, opened with the remarkable BONA FIDE that indeed there had been many previous prophecies, but the difference about the present one was that it was really true. Her conversation came to consist more and more of a perpetual attempt, and a perpetual failure, to tell stories and riddles. A more complete triumph of hope over experience it would be impossible to imagine. NEVER ONCE have I heard her reach the end of her anecdote without either missing the point or frankly breaking down \u2212 but with scarcely a pause she would embark upon another. If stories ceased for a moment, she would talk about the Kaiser \u2212 for whom, years after the war, she retained the pious hatred of 1915. I once remarked to her that we must remember the bad upbringing he had had. She replied, \u2018I don\u2019t want to hear anything of that sort.\u2019 The nearest meeting between her religious and patriotic views was a half tearful complaint, \u2018And yet it says you ought to forgive your enemies!\u2019 \u2026I do not know how it is \u2212 Mrs Greeves was a better woman than any true account of her would lead you to believe. Much she did that was bad, and all that she said was foolish: but somehow it was all forgiveable. One does not love the domestic cat less because it is greedy and thievish. Somehow these facts do not reach the heart of the mystery.<br/><br/>The children all (I believe) abandoned the religion of their parents. They had all been subjected to a baptism by total immersion EN MASSE when the youngest was about 12. It had been carried out in the bathroom where the young men, the young woman, and the boys, in their bathing suits, had been plunged one by one in a bath of tepid water. But I do not think that their religion had at any time been practised with much devotion by the younger generation. Certainly all, except Willie, bore the ugly marks of ex-Puritanism \u2212 of those who are brought up in a crude antithesis of Grace and Nature, and who therefore, when they abandon the Grace, straightway become startlingly natural. All revealed each passing sensation of greed, jealousy, anger, pleasure, or disappointment in an almost savage nakedness. Their upbringing gave them no HUMANE tradition to turn to when once their theology was gone.<br/><br/>[{24-26} On Arthur Greeves:]<br/><br/>My refusal to draw the character of Arthur Greeves has resulted in a portrait of him by another hand, which justice and charity oblige me to supplement. I do not contradict it, nor do I accuse it of malice. It is the work of one who knew the subject less intimately than myself and who saw only the surface of a character whose faults lay very obvious to the eye.<br/><br/>Arthur was the youngest son of a doting mother and a harsh father, two evils whereof each increased the other. The mother soothed him the more, to compensate for the father\u2019s harshness, and the father became harsher to counteract the ill effects of the mother\u2019s indulgence. Both thus conspired to aggravate a tendency (not rare in human nature) towards self pity, and some supernumerary bullying from an older brother was hardly likely to cure it. It can easily be imagined how such a child grew up: but who could have foretold that he would be neither a liar nor a tale bearer, neither a coward nor a misanthrope? He was the frankest of men. Many of the most ludicrous episodes which could be told against him, turn on his failure to acquire that \u2018visor to the human face\u2019 which such a training usually teaches a man to wear. He was the most faithful of friends, and carried the innumerable secrets of my own furtive and ignoble adolescence locked in a silence which is not commonly thought effeminate. Under illness or inconvenience he was impatient \u2212 a loud and violent, but not a lengthy grumbler: but danger left him unmoved. He was careless of heights and as a motorist was a rash though surprisingly competent driver. He was much isolated from his fellow men, not only by real and supposed ill health, but by literary and artistic tastes which none of his family and few of his neighbours shared.<br/><br/>Until I met him, and during my frequent absences, his position was much the same as that of an imaginative boy in one of our public schools. Yet he never showed any inclination to revenge himself after the fashion so familiar among our modern intelligentsia. He continued to feel \u2212 indeed he taught me to endeavour to feel with him \u2212 at once a human affection and a rich aesthetic relish for his antediluvian aunts,  [25]  his mill-owning uncles, his mother\u2019s servants, the postman on our roads, and the cottagers whom we met in our walks. What he called the \u2018Homely\u2019 was the natural food both of his heart and his imagination. A bright hearth seen through an open door as we passed, a train of ducks following a brawny farmer\u2019s wife, a drill of cabbages in a suburban garden \u2212 these were things that never failed to move him, even to an ecstasy, and he never found them incompatible with his admiration for Proust, or Wyndham Lewis, or Picasso.<br/><br/>He was completely unworldly. He never in his life read an \u2018advanced\u2019 book or imitated a \u2018modern\u2019 painter because he felt that he could thus become a superior being. The motive was always either his genuine pleasure in them, or else the advice of ill-chosen friends. For Arthur was both humble and unstable. He could be persuaded to read, or at least begin, any book: to adopt (for a time) any canon of taste. The last speaker was always right to him. But all these fluctuations went on over a fundamental constancy: to the charm of the \u2018homely\u2019 he was never untrue, and if he was easily drawn into the follies of any and every coterie, he could not, by any process, be infected with its pride.<br/><br/>During the earlier years of our acquaintance he was (as always) a Christian, and I was an atheist. But though (God forgive me) I bombarded him with all the thin artillery of a seventeen year old rationalist, I never made any impression on his faith \u2212 a faith both vague and confused, and in some ways too indulgent to our common weaknesses, but inexpugnable. He remains victor in that debate. It is I who have come round. The thing is symbolical of much in our joint history. He was not a clever boy, he was even a dull boy; I was a scholar. He had no \u2018ideas\u2019. I bubbled over with them. It might seem that I had much to give him, and that he had nothing to give me. But this is not the truth. I could give concepts, logic, facts, arguments, but he had feelings  to offer, feelings which most mysteriously \u2212 for he was always very inarticulate \u2212 he taught me to share. Hence, in our commerce, I dealt in superficies, but he in solids. I learned charity from him and failed,  for all my efforts, to teach him arrogance in return.<br/><br/>And since I have mentioned charity, I must speak of his \u2018charity\u2019 in the narrower sense. This was all his own, all virtue, and no nature. Heredity and early training had laid upon him as a natural curse the love of money, but he conquered it. He came to support, almost entirely, an unemployed man, and to offer me assistance in my lean times. He came (perhaps a harder thing for a constitutionally lazy man) to discharge regular duties in a charitable organisation. In this respect he defeated his nature. Against gluttony \u2212 another hereditary vice \u2212 he was less successful: he remained always a valetudinarian, though he was as much the dupe of doctors as of his self pity.<br/><br/>But if I had to write his epitaph, I should say of him what I could say of no one else known to me \u2212 \u2018He despised nothing.\u2019 Contempt \u2212 if not the worst, surely the most ludicrously inappropriate of the sins that [26] men commit \u2212 was, I believe, unknown to him. He fulfilled the Gospel precept: he \u2018judged not\u2019.",type:"Prose",notes:["The portraits of Greeves\u2019s parents derive from <i>LP</i> 3:302-304.","The portrait of Greeves derives from <i>LP</i> 10:218-220.

This is the Anvil in session again, with two old friends, Canon [F.A.] Cockin of St Paul\u2019s Cathedral and Father Andrew Beck, a Roman Catholic priest. And we welcome tonight the Reverend Dorothy Wilson, who has been Minister-in-Charge of the Muswell Hill Congregational Church, and also Mr C.S. Lewis, known to many of you through his broadcasts and his books. We hope to discuss and possibly answer four questions tonight, and the first is this. \u201cWill you please tell me what really happens when a person dies? Have you any proof or is it only faith that we shall meet our loved ones again?\u201d<br/><br/>[Canon Cockin pointed out that, even if it sounds brutal, the New Testament emphasis is on the importance of meeting God, not on meeting those we loved on earth.]<br/><br/>WELCH: Lewis, do you want to\u2026?<br/><br/>LEWIS: Well, yes. I was going to say very much what Cockin has said, so as he\u2019s said it for me, I\u2019ll confine myself to this, to try and make it sound a little less brutal. I fully agree with him that as long as you are thinking of God as merely as a sort of bridge by which you can get to your loved ones you\u2019re on the wrong track. But that doesn\u2019t mean of course that you can demand of a woman who\u2019s just lost her only son, say, that she\u2019s to alter her feelings and start caring more about God than about him. That\u2019s probably impossible. But if you will go to God just as you are, fully admitting that you care about Him very little, and put yourself in His hands, if you\u2019re even ready to be made to care and leave Him to work, He\u2019ll do the rest. And there\u2019s no question of anyone wanting you to love your son less than you do. God wants you to love him more. You will love him more than you do now when you\u2019ve learnt to love God most. Because, of course, whatever we think, we really don\u2019t know much about loving until we\u2019re in touch with love Himself.<br/><br/>WELCH: \u2026The second question \u2026is this. \u201cWhen the war began, I heard many parsons talk of courage, and they said you can\u2019t be brave unless you are a Christian. I can\u2019t believe this is true. What do the Anvil members think?\u201d Now what do you think, Lewis?<br/><br/>LEWIS: Well, I think the parsons who said that were talking bosh! It\u2019s perfectly obvious that you can have courage without being a Christian. Lots of Nazis are courageous, lots of animals are courageous. I think the real point is: what sources you\u2019re getting your courage from. Because, of course, all sorts of things will make a man brave for the time being. Alcohol, ignorance of the danger, anger, self-respect, human loyalty, and love of God. But they\u2019re not all equally good sources.<br/><br/>WELCH: \u2026Well now, the third question is, I think, an important one \u2026\u201cCould the Anvil tell me how to set about reading the Bible. I know that the Genesis account is untrue, and some Old Testament miracles are legendary. Now I hear parts of the New Testament were inserted in the fourth century, that Matthew didn\u2019t write the first Gospel, nor Paul the epistle to the Hebrews, and so on. Well, what are we to believe? I\u2019ve no time to be a scholar like the parsons. Can the Anvil please help me? I want to read the Bible, but I just don\u2019t know what to believe.\u201d Now Lewis, you\u2019re a teacher, can you \u2026?<br/><br/>LEWIS: Well, I\u2019d like to say straight away that if this man knows the Genesis account to be untrue I\u2019m wondering where he\u2019s picked up his information because I don\u2019t know anything about that from human knowledge \u2212 I believe it to be true. But I\u2019m not a biblical scholar so I can\u2019t go into the question. All I am in private life is a literary critic and historian, that\u2019s my job. And I\u2019m prepared to say on that basis if anyone thinks the Gospels are either legends or novels, then that person is simply showing his incompetence as a literary critic. I\u2019ve read a great many novels and I know a fair amount about the legends that grew up among early people, and I know perfectly well the Gospels are not that kind of stuff. They\u2019re absolutely full of the sort of things that don\u2019t come into legends. Take one simple example. The passage in which Our Lord is scribbling in the dust before He gives His answer about the woman taken in adultery. Nothing whatever comes of it, no doctrine has ever been based on it, it has no point at all; there\u2019s no conceivable reason why anyone should ever have written it down, unless he\u2019s seen it happening. From first to last the things strike me as records of fact. And, in my opinion, the people who think that any of the episodes in the Gospels are imaginary are the people who have no imagination themselves and have never understood what imaginative story-telling is. But of course I\u2019m not a biblical scholar. <br/><br/>[Miss Wilson mentioned that, even if it were true that Bacon wrote the plays ascribed to Shakespeare, it is the plays themselves that are important.]<br/><br/>LEWIS: There\u2019s just one point, since Miss Wilson mentioned Bacon and Shakespeare. I should like to say from my own subject of English literature that when I began they were playing with English literature just the same sort of thing they do with the Bible. <i>Henry the Sixth</i> was supposed to be by about six authors and they could tell which scene was by which. Well, that nonsense is all being blown away as far as I can make out in all subjects except Biblical criticism.<br/><br/>WELCH: \u2026Now I do want to pass to the last question \u2212 it\u2019s so important \u2026\u201cWhy does God allow suffering?\u201d<br/><br/>[Canon Cockin suggested that suffering resulted from people of evil wills, that which is necessary in a surgical ward, and natural disaster. He was followed by Father Beck who mentioned the view of the Archbishop of Canterbury \u2212 that suffering was inseparable from a perfect life, and evil inseparable from an imperfect one.]<br/><br/>WELCH: Lewis, do you accept that?<br/><br/>LEWIS: Well, no, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m very old-fashioned and simple here. I think in this world as it is, suffering is necessary for our cure and the cure of the whole universe, just like in Cockin\u2019s surgical ward. But I don\u2019t think you would need the cure of suffering nor the legs cut off unless something had gone wrong. And I think all the suffering in the world comes in the long run from evil wills. A great deal of it obviously comes from evil human wills, such as the war. But the things that are wrong in nature, I think, come from the evil wills of being[s] older and stronger than men. In fact, devils, if you like to use the old-fashioned word. It\u2019s not a popular view now \u2212 it was the view taken by Christ of the woman who was deformed. He said Satan had bound her. I think we are living in a world that has gone wrong. So that I would say that all suffering springs from wickedness in the long run, though not all from human wickedness.",type:"Prose",notes:null},{title:"Preface to \u201cScrewtape Proposes a Toast\u201d",printedIn:"<i>The Screwtape Letters with Screwtape Proposes a Toast,</i> revised edition (New York: Macmillan)",issueOrVolume:null,pageRange:"151-152",year:1982,monthAndDay:null,textProvided:"\u201cScrewtape Proposes a Toast\u201d was written years after the original <i>Screwtape Letters</i>. It takes over from them the technique of what may be called diabolical ventriloquism. Screwtape\u2019s outlook is like a photographic negative; his whites are our blacks and whatever he welcomes we ought to dread. But in the original <i>Letters</i> this device was applied to the religious and moral life of an individual. In the \u201cToast\u201d the main subject is education.<br/><br/>In my view there is a sense in which education ought to be democratic and another sense in which it ought not. It ought to be democratic in the sense of being available, without distinction, of sex, colour, class, race or religion, to all who can\u2014and will\u2014diligently accept it. But once the young people are inside the school there must be no attempt to establish a factitious egalitarianism between the idlers and dunces on the one hand and the clever and industrious on the other. A modern nation needs a very large class of genuinely educated people and it is the primary function of schools and universities to supply them. To lower standards or disguise inequalities is fatal. <br/><br/>If this sounds harsh, I would observe that the opposite policy is really devised to soothe the inferiority complex not of the idlers and dunces but of their parents. Do not be in the least afraid that those who live out their school-days\u2014which should be brief\u2014on the back bench of the lowest class will suffer any trauma when they see promotion and honours and official approval going to the diligent minority. They are stronger than it. They can punch its head and kick its stern. All the distinctions they really care about\u2014the popularity and the success in games\u2014go not to it but to them. They enjoy their school-days very much. Our real problem is to see that they impede as little as possible the purposes for which school really exists. <br/><br/>So far so good. But I had to face a tactical difficulty. The \u201cToast\u201d was published in an American magazine. [152] The tendency in education which I was deploring has gone further in America than anywhere else. If I had been writing \u201cstraight\u201d my article would have been an attack on the \u201cpublic schools\u201d of America. It would indeed have raised nothing that educated Americans do not fully admit. But it is one thing for them to say these things of their own country and another to hear them said by a foreigner! I therefore thought it neither good manners nor good tactics to make my point quite nakedly. Instead, I resorted to a further level of irony. Screwtape in fact describes American education; he affects to be holding the English education up as the awful example. The most intelligent of my American readers would, I hoped, see the game I was playing and enjoy the joke. And if those who were a little duller really believed that \u201cdemocratic\u201d education (in the true sense) had gone even further in England, they could not help seeing that their actual system was at least uncomfortably like the one Screwtape describes\u2014and draw the moral. <br/><br/>C.S.

This \u201ckingdom\u201d is in an old attic room of his father\u2019s house and its treasure consists of all the stories, plays, songs, and drawings that the young protagonist has accumulated since early childhood. The father in the story is introduced and when seated, \u201csilent and unmoving as a Yogi\u201d, the tension palpably increases and the character remarks that the silence of the little end room \u201cswelled like a bubble till I thought it must instantly burst into some undefined catastrophe.\u201d We learn that the son is fourteen and an only child (his mother had died \u201cin giving me birth\u201d). The fictional father is in some unspecified \u201cbusiness\u201d, though to the son this merely means that the father leaves the house in the morning and returns in the evening. On his father\u2019s return, the youth would have to be seated in the dining room next to the fire, having been \u201cforbidden\u201d to sit in his \u201ckingdom\u201d by his father due to his weak chest and persistent colds. The rest of the fragment attempts to articulate and assert his, rather melodramatic, sense of individuality.<br/><br/>[32-33, with Lewis\u2019s words in quotes:]<br/><br/>Text A also contains an account of adolescent angst that suggests an imaginative amalgamation of his schoolboy experiences at Campbell College. We learn that the young protagonist made no friends, was in his own words \u201ca thoroughgoing snob\u201d, and having surmounted bullying and general unhappiness, wins at least toleration from his fellow pupils. The image of the \u201cbig house\u201d and the \u201ckingdom\u201d therein as sanctuary and refuge from the, \u201cclamour of the boys, the playground, the sordid books\u201d, is subtly evoked. Following the road up the hill beyond his father\u2019s house and leaving behind \u201cthe fields and works of men\u201d, Text A\u2019s protagonist passes solitary hours upon the moor smoking cigarettes, reading, writing, and staring \u201cmyself dizzy upon the blue hills or (lying in the heather) upon the tremendous cliffs and towers of summer cloud, eating out my heart with vague and indistinguishable desires.\u201d Inevitably, the consequence of being such a \u201cvain, introspective, prurient, and romantic\u201d boy was the derision of his peers and this is masterfully and painfully portrayed in Text A, where he describes himself as a \u201cdull, slouching, unattractive boy\u201d. Envying his more popular peers, the \u201cenforced spectator\u201d attempts to ingratiate himself by joining in their conversation, perhaps with a joke \u201clong meditated\u201d in solitude, only to be jeered, red-faced, into embarrassed silence. He finds compensation for this treatment in dreams where he is the \u201chero\u201d and people do not \u201cstare or titter\u201d when he speaks, and if they do he [33] at least has the courage and strength to hit back. This unfinished story ends with the boy returning home to his father, after a day on the moors, to face his fate. What this fate is we do not know but the imagery used suggests is not good: it is cold and dark and has been raining all day: \u201ca cold, slanting rain with a wind that bent the trees and sent their surviving leaves up-sky in showers, wheeling like crows\u201d. The abrupt break in the fragment leaves us wondering just what this confrontation with the father entails...<br/><br/>[90, with Lewis\u2019s words in quotes:]<br/><br/>Having incorporated the same idea into his early fiction, written in his teens and known as Text A, we again see the dominant image of the Ulster landscape exerting its influence. The young protagonist in the fragment describes the allure of the surrounding Holywood Hills, and the distant Mourne mountains, \u201csource of all my dreams perhaps even to this day\u201d and questions th ability of the artist to \u201crecapture that strange longing, that discontent\u2026?\u201d",type:"Prose",notes:null},{title:"Excerpt from early short story Text B (<i>LP</i> 11:254-255)",printedIn:"Ronald W.

There was in Shakespeare\u2019s time no anthropology to make men believe that black men had smaller brains or skulls of the wrong shape. There was no imperialism to make men think of them as members of subject races: no recent memory of Negro slavery [to?] make men think of them as the dregs of society.<br/><br/>[38]<br/><br/>At Othello\u2019s first entry we should have our minds quite clear both of modern arrogance about backward races and of modern enlightenment and the brotherhood of man. We must concentrate with a primitive sharpness of vision in the physical fact: a group of men coming in by torchlight and in the midst of them, monstrous, not to be got over, the staring black face and red lips\u2014a figure equally suitable for some crude kind of mumming farce or . . . tragedy about Christian maidens imprisoned . . . far over seas.<br/><br/>This play is not the story of a girl who married below herself, but of a girl who married a sort of ogre or hobgoblin.<br/><br/>And then, at once, Shakespeare begins doing more. . . . The Black Man begins talking. He is the descendant of kings. Not \u201cchiefs\u201d as a modern might call them: the Elizabethans have no pictures of Kraals . . . or \u201cnative\u201d villages in their minds. They are more likely to base ideas on Prester John and an Ethiopian of Heliodorus, and even the African kings of Ariosto, and even Melchior.<br/><br/>The creature is noble in its own way: none the less perilous or mysterious for that. But the idea is fascinating: it has the attraction of a good giant, or a chivalrous Turk.<br/><br/>[40]<br/><br/>We see them together for the first time: the fair, gentle, foolish, loving lady and the heroic, far-advanced blackamore, with his flash of tooth and eye. Neither here nor in later scenes where we see them embrace, must there be any physical disgust. Nor, on the other hand, must there be any watery stuff about her being quite right to love his mind rather than his face. There must be a good old ballad . . . the theme is Beauty and the Beast or the Princess and the Goblin, or Freya promised to the giants.<br/><br/>Production should not evade Othello\u2019s colour by making him look like an Arab. In my opinion, it is not as important (in itself) to have a real Negro in the part. Burnt cork strikes the proper [41] note. If this note is properly struck at the outset most of the questions about Othello\u2019s behaviour will never arise. Obviously, he may do <i>anything</i>.

This method undoubtedly makes a book easy to follow but it has one serious drawback. It tends to give you the impression that the things said in the later chapters are based or founded on the things said in the earlier, just as the later propositions in geometry are based on the earlier. If this impression is left to operate unchecked the reader may even come to feel that our statements about primitive or original languages are more certain than those we make about modern language, or if the former were the <i>data</i> or the latter a kind of development in reality, however, it is the opposite. We know a great deal about modern language, and less about ancient; and anything we can say about prehistoric language, can only be guesswork. The whole basis of knowledge on which that guesswork is built is our knowledge of modern language. We must therefore begin with it. Any speculations we can make about an unknown past or the unknowable beginnings must come at the end. That will help to emphasize their merely speculative character. We begin, then, with an attempt to say what language is.<br/><br/>A language, in the widest sense, is a system of signs. Thus there is a language of flags (used in the navy), a \u201clanguage of flowers\u201d, and [2] so forth. But there is one such system of signs so widely used and so much richer than all the others that it generally is called simply \u201clanguage.\u201d This is the system in which the signs are the various noises made by a human mouth. It is Language in this sense, which is the subject of the present book.<br/><br/>But our definition is still too broad. For example, a groan or cry is a noise made by a human mouth and it may be a sign that the noise of a mouth which makes it is in pain. But it is not what we usually call language. We only see language in its full sense when the noises made not only are signs but are intended to be signs by the person who makes them.<br/><br/>This is sometimes expressed by saying that language is vocal noise with a meaning. This will do well enough provided that we remember, or distinguish, the different senses of the word meaning. It has at least three.<br/><br/>1. \u201cThat sky means rain\u201d. By saying this we intend to convey that the state of the sky is a sign of rain, in the sense that it is evidence (whether certain or probable) that rain will presently begin to fall. <i>We</i> are not necessarily saying that crying or anything is intentionally making signs to us. We are stating grounds on which we are prepared to make a prediction.<br/><br/>2. \u201cI mean to go to London to-morrow.\u201d This might be translated \u2013 \u201cI intend, propose, am resolved to go London to-morrow\u201d. [3]<br/><br/>3. \u201cThe sign = means that the two qualities are equal\u201d or \u201cis a sign of equality.\u201d This must be carefully distinguished from the First [sic] sense. The two strokes are not \u201ca sign of\u201d equality or the same as being evidence of equality. If we take the expression a = b as evidence that a does in fact equal b that will be because we believe the writer to be a sound mathematician and an honest man. Even if the expression were quite unbelievable (e.g. 5 = 12) we should still say that the sign \u201cmeant\u201d equality: indeed we should only know a statement to be untrue because we knew that the sign meant \u201cequals\u201d (if the writer was using it to mean \u201cis less than,\u201d his statements would no longer be untrue). Now this third kind of meaning is the one that language principally has and it is hardest to define. To mean, in this sense, is \u201cto draw attention to,\u201d \u201cis present in the mind\u201d. But that is not quite enough. A groan may draw our attention to the pain of the man who groans, and the colour of the sky may make us think of rain. But the sign = does not only in fact draw our attention to, or offer to the mind, the relation of equality, but <i>is intended</i> to do so. To mean, in this third sense is \u201cto draw attention to not accidentally but on purpose\u201d.<br/><br/>These three senses can now be distinguished as the Evidential [4] (that the sky means rain)[,] the psychological (I mean to go to London) and the symbolical (= means equality) senses of the new meaning. We can now define language as the system of vocal noises <i>meant</i> (psychological sense) to mean (symbolic sense).<br/><br/>Two points had better be cleared up before we proceed.<br/><br/>1. Some have attempted to give what may be called an Associated account of psychological meaning. According to the sentence, \u201cThe word Radish means an edible reddish root with a hot taste\u201d can be translated \u201cThe word Radish is so associated in my mind with the root that when I hear or read it the imagination of the word inevitably occurs to my mind\u201d. Now it is certainly the case that words do in fact thus call into inference by association memory-images of what they mean. But it does not follow and not prove to mean much [sic] in their doing this. The writers believe that it does not. For (a) Things which are (in the symbolical sense of the word) meaningless do this quite as much as words, if not more: e.g. smells, or natural sounds. (b) in one man\u2019s mind the word \u201ccross channel boat\u201d may be primarily associated with a honeymoon: in another\u2019s with being torpedoed. Yet they can understand one another when they use the word. To this those who hold the Associational theory reply that one instance does not prove that meaning is something quite distinct from Association, but only that the meaning is a special selection from the images [5] associated with the word. Thus both men have dozens of associations with <i>cross-channel boat,</i> but each person has to select from the word that limited number of associations which is required for ordinary talk. But this seems to amount to giving up the Associational theory altogether. For if we ask <i>what</i> selection is required, surely we must answer \u201cThat selection which the word is intended to call up when used by speakers who know English.\u201d What makes this the thing meant by the word is not the mere fact that they are called up but knowledge that the other speaker intends to call them up. In talking with children or imbeciles we do sometimes find that our words are merely evoking associations: we ask \u201cHas your mother gone out\u201d and are told \u201cMother made a cake to-day.\u201d The impossibility of any real conversation on such terms helps to show how far meaning is from mere association.<br/><br/>2. Although language is the system of vocal noises meant (psychological sense) to mean (symbolical sense) yet of course most language, quite apart from the speaker\u2019s intention also \u201cmeans\u201d in the first sense, the evidential. Thus the tone of the speaker\u2019s voice may be evidence for all sorts of things which are distinct from what he means (in the symbolical sense). Or the mere fact of his saying a certain thing may be a sign of, be evidence for, something else. \u201cHe says he\u2019s got a headache[,] that means he [6] is afraid to-come up the mountain.[\u201d] This may be perfectly true if we know our man; the excuse may be good evidence for his fear. But obviously the words \u201cI am ill\u201d do not mean \u201cI am afraid\u201d in the symbolical sense, nor does the speaker mean (in a psychological sense) to tell us that he is afraid. Conversely, noises which are not ordinarily symbolical may be used with the intention of conveying information to us. A man may groan for the expressed purpose of letting us know that he is in pain. In this case the kind of noise which normally has a meaning only in case I (the Evidential) is being temporarily pressed into service as Language and given a symbolical meaning.<br/><br/>Let us now return to our definition of language as a system of vocal noises meant (sense I) to mean (sense III). Before this will quite do, a further distinction has to be made. If we went out for a walk with a man and he suddenly utters the single word \u201cTable\u201d we should probably ask him what he meant. We might go on to say that the word \u201cTable\u201d all by itself is meaningless. And in one sense, so it is. In another sense we know perfectly well that the word Table has a meaning and after a little patience, we could all say what it meant. It begins to look as if single words (or at any rate some single words) have meaning in one sense, and sentences have meaning in some different sense. [7]<br/><br/>This suspicion is later borne out by the following fact. If a man utters a sentence which contains a word we don\u2019t know, we tend to ask him what <i>that word means</i>. But if he utters a sentence which we don\u2019t understand (though we know all the words in it) we are much more likely to ask him what <i>he means</i>.<br/><br/>Before going any further it will be well to issue an emphatic warning against what the authors consider to be one wrong conception of the problem. It is a very tempting one. The temptation is to say that the single word, or at any rate the words mean things, as the sentences mean thoughts. Thus table can mean a piece of furniture but \u201cThere is a bigger table in the next room\u201d would mean that the speaker has a mental picture of the next room with the bigger table in it, and that he was mentally connecting the idea of the room with the idea of the bigger table, or that he was (as the logicians say) \u201cjudging\u201d that the next room contains a bigger table. Now what is true is that unless he is lying, he probably has the mental picture, and certainly connects the ideas and certainly makes the judgment. His uttering the sentence is therefore evidence for the dates or events in his own mind: that is it means (evidential sense) that they are occurring. But does it also mean this in the symbolical sense? It would appear not. For if that were so we should never be talking about anything but our own [8] states of mind. And though it is clear that we are sometimes talking about our own states of mind, it is also quite clear that we often talk about other things. Indeed we often contrast our own states of mind with the thing. The man says \u201cThere is a bigger table in the next room.\u201d His friend may rudely reply \u201cSo <i>you</i> think.\u201d \u201cOf course I do,\u201d he may retort, \u201cotherwise I wouldn\u2019t have said so. But I\u2019ll show you in a moment that the room is as I thought.\u201d (It might of course be maintained by certain philosophers that what we call Things are only a special kind of thought, but we need not bother with that question here. It would still remain true and we often talk about that special kind of thought which one calls Things, and not talk about the kind purposely called \u201cstates of our own minds[\u201d.])",type:"Prose",notes:null},{title:"\u201cScraps\u201d of ideas in notebook with Lefay fragment and \u201cLanguage and Human Nature\u201d fragment",printedIn:"Steven A.

But what would a literary critic say? I talked to Professor C.S. Lewis at his home in Oxford. I asked him to comment on this passage from an essay by Lionel Trilling: \u201cI see no reason in morality or aesthetic theory why literature should not have as one of its intentions, the arousing of thoughts of lust. It\u2019s one of the effects, perhaps one of the functions, of literature, to arouse desire and I can discover no grounds for saying that sexual pleasure should not be among the objects of desire which literature presents to us along with heroism, virtue, peace, death, food, wisdom, God, etc\u201d. <br/><br/> C.S. LEWIS: Well actually I don\u2019t agree with you about stimulating the other things, I mean I don\u2019t think literature is operating as literature when it is simply and directly stimulating these emotions in a practical way. [The] Devotional case is the most interesting as we know that ghastly works of art are treated as icons with a great devotional value and some really great works of art are not. In the same way I think that a poem which merely promotes immediate patriotic feeling of a practical sort is usually not great poetry and quite inferior things would do this quite as well often. <br/><br/>WY: ... Because it\u2019s too concentrated on one thing. ... <br/><br/>CSL: Well, also Wordsworth defined poetry, didn\u2019t he, as emotion recollected in tranquillity. There are some things which can\u2019t very well be recollected in tranquillity. I would say the same about literature [that] very vividly presented an intense physical pain, that you cannot be detached enough about these things to treat them in an imaginative way, with the distance and so on which is necessary for imaginative experience.<br/><br/>WY: Well, what about the four-letter words themselves?<br/><br/>CSL: Well, I think from a moral point of view that\u2019s utterly unimportant. I don\u2019t think that such words are to most people inflammatory. In fact, in the past, in the 17th century, some poems were condemned for using four-letter words simply because they were not aphrodisiac. People [who] went to these poems expecting pornographic pleasure didn\u2019t get [it] precisely because the language was so crude.<br/><br/>WY: It was a criticism in fact.<br/><br/>CSL: Yes. Yes.<br/><br/>WY: That\u2019s interesting. Is there a parallel between the use of the four-letter word and \u2013 um \u2013 the difficulty of the use of the four-letter word, and any difficulty in the visual arts?<br/><br/>CSL: I want there to think of the difference between literature and the other works of art. The point being this you see: supposing I\u2019m drawing a nude, let\u2019s say a male nude, because it\u2019s more obvious. In most states of society I am allowed to draw everything I saw, whereas if in similar detail I described a male nude the difficulty arises. Here the point is this: in the case of the picture, when I come to the genitals I still go on drawing lines as if I was doing a shoulder. In the case of literature I\u2019ve got to use words and at once I am presented, I think, with only three choices; either a scientific word, or a four-letter word, or a babyish word. That is, I must call up either the atmosphere of the laboratory, or that of the gutter, or that of the nursery, and I may not want any of these three for my purpose. There therefore is an inherent difficulty in literature, because its medium is language, which does not arise when you\u2019re simply drawing. This is not a moral question, but it is a real difficulty in technique.<br/><br/>WY: This thing about the actual choice of words to use in erotic scenes, in written erotic scenes, one is up against the example of books where the four-letter words have been used with serious intent like Aretino in the Renaissance and, of course, <i>Lady Chatterley</i> recently. What about the effect of these?<br/><br/>CSL: Well, I haven\u2019t read either Aretino or <i>Lady Chatterley\u2019s Lover</i>.<br/><br/>WY: Presumably the difficulty in the choice of words is something which would affect life as well as literature, isn\u2019t it?<br/><br/>CSL: Well, I think so. Looking at most of the literature of the past, it seems to be the rule, doesn\u2019t it, that these things are not nakedly mentioned, except either in bitter satire, vituperation, or else in broad farce. I mean, looking at Greek literature, you can\u2019t read ten lines of a comedy \u2013 I mean the old comedy, Aristophanes \u2013 without coming across terrific indecencies; on the other hand you can read the whole <i>Iliad</i> or <i>Odyssey</i> \u2013 the tragedies too \u2013 without anything of the sort. It is kept for the comedies and for the violently angry.<br/><br/>WY: And what about the parts of the Latin lyric poets which we regard as unusually... ?<br/><br/>CSL: Well, that\u2019s the whole point, you see, that Horace will use a four-letter word in a satirical passage, but when you get Ovid or Propertius actually describing the night with the girl, no such word is ever used and the organs themselves are referred to in delicate and most uninflammatory paraphrases \u2013 that\u2019s just the difference. This is if Lawrence... Lawrence\u2019s way of treating it, I gather, is a breach of the whole history of language, is fighting against the very bent of human language and especially using very serious passages.<br/><br/>WY: What about \u2013 what is good Erotic writing? Let\u2019s talk about some practical examples in English writing .<br/><br/>CSL: Oh well, I should have thought <i>Hero and Leander</i> was \u2013 um \u2013 I should have thought a good deal of Chaucer\u2019s <i>Troilus and Criseyde</i> was... I should have thought that in Shakespeare\u2019s <i>Troilus and Cressida</i> \u2013 Troilus\u2019s speech before the assignation \u2013 mark you, that is not about the act itself, but about the young man\u2019s anticipation of the act. That\u2019s where I think literature does far better on states of feeling and so on. [The] description of things moving in space in relation to one another \u2013 [that] literature can hardly do at all, I mean you can\u2019t describe in words what a pair of scissors or a corkscrew is like, this is quite impossible. Well, I admit the sexual act is less complicated than that, but still it is not what literature really does best. You\u2019d much better stick to what the people felt like.<br/><br/>WY: Is it ever so that the evil content of a book can be redeemed by the beauty of execution?<br/><br/>CSL: Ah no, I don\u2019t think so \u2013 that would seem to me to be the confusion that\u2019s in people\u2019s minds \u2013 they seem to be asking is this a good work of art or is it calculated to do harm to the readers. There\u2019s no reason why it shouldn\u2019t be both, I mean you might have a circus act which you objected to because you knew that the training involved great cruelty to animals. It wouldn\u2019t follow that it wasn\u2019t a thoroughly good act, showing great grace and agility, great training and ease and beauty. These are two separate issues: I mean it is quite possible that the thing might be good art and have a great deleterious effect on the reader or viewer, ah ah, that it should be disapproved, I say should be disapproved: whether it should be suppressed by the police or not is another question.<br/><br/>WY: Now as well as \u2013 perhaps it\u2019s wrong to say \u201cas well as\u201d, but you\u2019re known as not only a literary critic, but as a Christian moralist.<br/><br/>CSL: Yes.<br/><br/>WY: Are the two things so much the same that we can\u2019t talk separately on the two topics or is there another approach?<br/><br/>CSL: Oh, ah, I think they\u2019re quite separate. I don\u2019t see any difficulty in saying, \u201cI as a Christian would be wrong to allow myself this kind of reading, would be wrong, but if I have to read it [... to say] this is very well written\u201d.<br/><br/>WY: And in general from the standpoint of Christian morality, the description of lovemaking in literature is on a par with the description of anything else, or less so?<br/><br/>CSL: Well, I think the description of any immoral action whether in the sexual sphere or any other, if so contrived as to produce a tendency to that action in the mind of the reader, I would condemn. Though whether I would impose my Christian condemnation through the law for non-Christian fellow citizens is quite a different matter.<br/><br/>WY: Supposing it\u2019s not an immoral action, supposing it\u2019s between husband and wife? And yet is described very vividly?<br/><br/>CSL: Well, I suppose one thinks there that this sort of thing tends to lead to masturbation on the part of the young reader, but perhaps one ought to say rather that it should be kept away from the young reader. That it ought to be kept away from everyone, I really just don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s likely to be very [good?] art because, as I said earlier, I don\u2019t think some things can be, as in Wordsworth\u2019s phrase, recollected in tranquillity, and also, stimulation of this particular impulse does not really seem to be very necessary.<br/><br/>WY: Well, the next thing is, of course, is masturbation a wrong action?<br/><br/>CSL: Well, I think I would say to that unless you hold, as I do hold, the specifically Christian view of the human body, I\u2019m not very clear that it is morally wrong. It may be bad as it incapacitates a person, and I don\u2019t mean physically, but psychologically incapacitating him for real love affairs, but I don\u2019t know \u2013 I\u2019m only guessing there.<br/><br/>WY: Now what in your view is overall right or wrong in modern erotic literature?<br/><br/>CSL: Well, what repels me \u2013 that\u2019s perhaps easier than saying \u201cright or wrong\u201d \u2013 is what I would call the appalling solemnity. I remember saying to a pupil once that I thought a certain novel pornographic, and he replied, \u201cHow can it be? \u2013 he treats it all so seriously.\u201d Now this seems to me so awfully wrong. The sexual act is often very serious to both parties, but more often, quite as often, it is more in the form of a play or romp, especially with married people; and all humanity knows this \u2013 it is always connected with jokes. The Greeks knew that the goddess of love was the laughter-loving goddess, and this is what seems to be entirely crushed out by, what I would call, our modern aphroditology, if I might coin this nasty word \u2013 the serious worship of Aphrodite.<br/><br/>WY: But might not literature be a very good means to mend this?<br/><br/>CSL: Oh, I think that\u2019s a very good example of what verse and wit does; that you can say in a modern lewd limerick, when it\u2019s really quite fun, what in cold prose would simply be abysmal.<br/><br/>WY: Chilling.<br/><br/>CSL: Yes, Yes. Well, just worthless like something scrawled on a lavatory wall.<br/><br/>WY: Dirty stories?<br/><br/>CSL: Oh well, the one reason I want to keep up some censorship is that the so-called dirty story, let\u2019s say the indecent story, as one hears it in many bars \u2013 where it is not at all indecent and not at all disgusting and often told with great wit and humour \u2013 this is the only folk art we\u2019ve got left, and once you allow all these things into literature, that surviving folk art will disappear and will be replaced by a professional art of the same sort which I think will be simply ghastly.",type:"Prose",notes:null},{title:"\u201cThe Easley Fragment\u201d",printedIn:"David C.

Paul or of S. Augustine must have been surprised when he first looked into Christian writings at the extent to which these authors are pre-occupied with polemics, not against Paganism, but against other sects of Christianity. He would have learned with amazement that a group of cognate movements which he had hitherto classed together was involved in violent internal dissension. He would have realised, for the [32] first time, the eagerness of the orthodox teachers not only to establish their doctrine as against the prevalent philosophies of ancient civilisation but also to distinguish it and disentangle it as clearly as possible from all those other doctrines which bore a superficial resemblance to it. A similar surprise awaits the modern who turns for the first time to study the writings of the Bolshevists. Here again we find the same zeal for orthodoxy: here again, when we first look carefully, we see the sharp antagonisms of a group of movements which we ignorant outsiders had roughly classed together. I, at least, must confess that I had hitherto thought of extreme democracy, Bolshevism, Menshevism and the rest as things differing in degree but not in kind. I had supposed that they were all simply shades of the colour red, which remained homogenous in all its variations from blood crimson to the pink of a rosebud. It was therefore an enlightenment to me to read Lenin\u2019s little work on The State and Revolution. Where I had looked for attacks on Capitalism I found attacks on Official Socialism, Anarchism and the school of Kautsky:  and the author is as bitter against these revolutionary heretics as against the capitalists themselves. No doubt this antagonism between groups whose likeness seems to us so much more important than their difference may at first raise a smile. But if we go no further than the smile we should be as foolish as our imaginary Roman would have been if he had dismissed with contempt the distinctions of early Christian orthodoxy and early Christian heresy. It is natural for a movement to wish to be itself: and no difference is too small for men who believe that vital principles are involved. We must understand before we can criticize: and for this reason it is worth while to study orthodox Bolshevism at first hand in the pages of Lenin himself.<br/><br/>Lenin\u2019s little book \u201cThe State and Revolution\u201d was composed in the August and September of 1917. It was interrupted by his own share in The Russian crisis, an interruption which, as the author tells us \u201ccan only be welcomed\u201d since \u201cit is more pleasant and more useful to live through  the experience of a revolution than to write about it.\u201d The main purpose of the book is to recall revolutionary thinkers to what the author regards as genuine revolutionary doctrine, and to warn them against the corruptions of that doctrine by those whom he denounces as \u201cOpportunist\u201d or \u201cOfficial\u201d socialists. Under this designation he includes the Austrian Kautsky (of whom I shall have something to say presently) and the English Fabians. For the actual Labour party in England to day he would doubtless find a harder name.<br/><br/>Lenin bases his teaching on the work of the nineteenth century communist writers, Karl Marx and Engels: those \u201cwells of purest Bolshevism undefiled\u201d of whom he always speaks with profound reverence. They are, in fact, his scriptures, his canonical books, whose priceless doctrine must be preserved intact. According to Lenin this doctrine is in great danger of being diluted or as he says \u201cvulgarised\u201d: for it is a favourite device of the bourgeoisie first [33] to emasculate and then to honour with lip service the teaching of a revolutionary whom they had persecuted in his life. This in fact is what the Kautsky school are now doing with Marx and Engels.<br/><br/>To combat this tendency Lenin re-states in all its original vigour the fundamental attitude of Marx and Engels  towards the state. Their doctrine is profoundly interesting. Just as Hobbes, Rousseau and Spinoza had done, so Marx and Engels in their turn attempt to explain the origin of the state. Like Hobbes and Spinoza they look back to an earlier stage of society when the state did not exist. How, then, and why did it come into existence? Hobbes and Spinoza had answered this question very simply. In the state of nature which preceded the political state there was a continual collision of wills, resulting in a permanent condition of war: and men, to escape from such an intolerable inconvenience,  resolved themselves into a political organism by a species of contract. (Each man forfeited his natural right of murdering his neighbour in return for the political right of being safe from murder himself.) Marx and Engels, on the other hand, do not regard the primitive society as a condition of war. The purely non-political, tribal life is, for them, a condition of peace and harmony and indeed, if I mistake not, the golden age. In such a condition the state could not come into existence and would have no purpose to serve. It is only when a given society has become hopelessly entangled that the need for the state, and the state itself appear. That which produces the entanglement is class antagonism. When a society  has fallen apart into classes with opposite interests a repressive force becomes necessary. But we must not suppose (and Lenin is very emphatic on this point) that the State appears as the intermediary or reconciler between the opposing classes. On the contrary, it is only when the class antagonisms have become absolutely irreconcilable that the State arises, not as an arbitrator but as the instrument by which the successful class oppresses the defeated classes. The appearance of the state marks not the solution of the class antagonisms but their suppression by the ruthless victory of one of the combatants. The Mensheviks, Lenin tells us, are guilty of a gross heresy when they suppose that the state is the arbitrator between classes. It is, on the contrary, an instrument of legalized class despotism.<br/><br/>From these premises the rest of Lenin\u2019s position follows logically enough. The state, thus generated, is obviously a disease of society. Its characteristics are prisons and a professional army and these indicate its repressive and despotic character. It is not any particular form of state which Lenin is condemning, but the State as such. Political democracy is to him on the same level with monarchy. They are both States, parasitic growths upon society, existing only in order that some dominant class may repress and exploit the proletariat. Hence Lenin drives home the sharp distinction between true Bolshevism and the extreme political democracy which seemed to some of us not unlike it. To strive for the amelioration of social conditions within the [34] state, to scatter universal suffrage and distribute doles \u2013 all this is useless in Lenin\u2019s eyes. Engels indeed regards the universal suffrage of democratic countries as a specially clever instrument of Capitalist domination: and the Parliamentary system means only that the oppressed proletariat have, every few years, the opportunity of choosing which members of the ruling class will oppress them. The State itself must be overturned. Those who labour to reform the state instead of destroying it are traitors to the Proletariat and whether consciously or unconsciously are working for the continuation of despotism. The state is the mark of a diseased society, and the first step towards social health is to be rid of it.<br/><br/>Lenin\u2019s next problem  naturally arises round the condition of society which is to follow the overthrow of the State. But his exposition is rendered rather confused by the fact that he feels obliged first to denounce some heresies which have been circulated by those he calls the Official Socialists. Engels, it appears, had remarked that the rise of the Proletariat would be followed by the withering away of the state. The Official Socialists have interpreted this to mean that with the advance of the Proletarian movement the State, now useless in a happier world, will gradually and peaceably fall into ruins and finally die a natural death. From this they have argued against the use of violence and pleaded that the advance may come not by revolution but by evolution. According to Lenin there could be no more disastrous misinterpretation of Engels\u2019 real meaning. Engels, we are told, insists on the necessity of overthrowing the existing state by the application of violence. The Proletariat must first take possession with bomb and bayonet. It is only after this that the \u201cwithering away\u201d process can begin. For Lenin maintains that the Proletariat, thus raised to power, cannot immediately dispense with political organization. The revolution will not immediately lead us to our goal of extinguishing the State. It is thus that Lenin finds himself in opposition to the Anarchists. The Anarchists wish to pass at one stride from the miseries of capitalist domination to the free society in which there is no law nor state whatsoever. Such a society, however, as Lenin points out, can only be realised when human nature has become different. But Lenin does not want to wait till then. The result of Anarchism is, in effect, to put off the revolution into the indefinite future: Lenin wants it at once: and if the revolution is to come at once we must still look forward to a new state existing after the revolution. It is this new state which is to \u201cwither away\u201d and finally conduct us to that millennium in which there shall be no state at all.<br/><br/>What, then, is to be the nature of the Proletarian state which will emerge from the revolution? Its nature is summed up for Lenin in the historic words \u201cDictatorship of the Proletariat.\u201d Every state, as we saw, is the organ of despotism exercised by one class over another: the Proletarian state will therefore be a simple despotism exercised by the armed workers over the other classes. In this it will be little different from previous states: There will [35] be nothing but a change of masters. Lenin, nevertheless, labours to show that this state will be as unlike a state, as little political, as is compatible with its existence. The primitive element of the constitution will be the group of workers, the commune or Soviet, working through its elected officials. Every care will be taken, however, to keep these officials close to their electors and to prevent them from becoming an official class. They will receive ordinary workmens\u2019 pay and they will be removable by the commune at a moment\u2019s notice. There will be no bureaucracy. Capitalism has already so far simplified the business of the state that we need no mystery nor esoteric skill. The true image of the Proletarian officials is to be found in the clerks and sorters of the present day post office. The councils in which these humble officials meet will be very different from the Parliaments of the present day. As Lenin not unjustly observes, a Parliament tends to be a mere talking shop: the real business of government is carried on in secret by the heads of departments. The Proletarian council however will be its own executive: it will be a working committee. The distinction between legislative and executive power will disappear. The representatives of the commune, immediately removable by the commune will meet to discuss what is to be done and will do it themselves. There will be no division between them and the people.<br/><br/>Such is the new state, the Dictatorship of the Proletariat, which rises after the revolution, though only with the pious hope of \u201cwithering away.\u201d It must not be confused with Democracy. The internal organization of the Proletariat into its Soviets may seem democratic: but the Proletariat as a whole will give no share of its liberty to other classes. As Engels remarks \u201cThe Proletariat needs the state not in the interests of liberty but for the purpose of crushing its opponents\u201d: or, to quote Lenin\u2019s own words, the communist state means \u201cDemocracy for the vast majority of the nation, and the suppression by force \u2013 that is, the exclusion from democracy \u2013 of the exploiters and oppressors.\u201d Being in the majority the Proletariat will find it far easier to repress their late masters than the masters ever found it to oppress them. They will not need any such complex machinery as the Capitalists had naturally needed in their day. Indeed, as Lenin grimly remarks, all that is necessary can be affected by the \u201corganization of the armed masses.\u201d<br/><br/>Having made this distinction Lenin goes on to explain the Marxian doctrine of the phases through which the Proletarian state will pass in its process of withering away towards the final extinction of all stateship. The first and lowest phase will be a condition of what is ordinarily called socialism. Classes will have disappeared: the means of production will belong to the people as a whole: every one will work and every one will receive a share of the common goods in strict proportion to his work. This, however, says Lenin, is only \u201cbourgeois justice\u201d: necessary for a time, no doubt, but to be superseded. His argument, if I understand it aright, is like this. Men are naturally unequal: their work is unequal: a distribution of [36] wealth in proportion to work done will therefore be unequal and unjust. We must therefore look forward to a second or higher stage of Communism. In this phase the opposition between brain and manual work will have disappeared: labour will be no longer a means of supporting life but rather itself one of the necessities of life. At that level we shall transcend the imperfect bourgeois justice which gives to each man according to his services, and adopt instead the truly communistic formula \u201cFrom each according to his ability: to each according to his need.\u201d<br/><br/>Thus, at the end of 105 closely printed pages, the conjuror has brought the rabbit out of the hat. Here is the goal of the Bolshevist adventure, together with the steps by which the goal is to be reached. At this point I would willingly omit all reference to the abominations of Bolshevist practice which are perhaps no more relevant  here than the Romanoff abominations would be in a discussion on monarchy. Let us be content, for the moment, to study the Bolshevist theory. How far can the doctrines of Marx & Engels be regarded as a helpful addition to political thought? Do they offer us anything that is new or useful \u2013 anything calculated to show us the road of escape from the difficulties of our own time?<br/><br/>The fundamental assumption of the Marxian theory is, as we saw, that the State is a disease. Before the state was the non-political tribal society: after the state will be that society in which we ask from each according to his ability & give to each according to his needs. I do not quite understand how far the future period when the state has vanished is to be different (if at all) from the historical period before the state arose. Some general similarity Lenin appears glad to recognize. The absence of separate classes, the absence of specialisation, the wielding of force not by an army but by the whole armed mass of the tribe \u2013 these at any rate are points of resemblance. It is this which first gives me pause. We know something of these primitive societies in which classes and political organization has not yet arisen \u2013 some even in which a fairly complete communism is practised: but what we know does not inspire us to imitate them. Must civilised man sit at the feet of savages? It was excusable for the eighteenth century to indulge in dreams about the \u201cnoble savage\u201d: it is not excusable for us who have modern anthropology at our command. We know too well the characteristics of primitive society, \u2013 the human sacrifices, the obscene and childish superstitions, the untroubled sensuality, the contented wallowing of the human animal in its native sty. Never again can we believe that by looking backward we shall find the forward road. To be sure, Lenin may reply that we are wrong in attributing to the free society of the future the grosser horrors of the pre-political savage society. Times have changed and it will be a man with centuries of civilisation behind him and modern science at his command who enters upon the final phase of communism. It is gratuitous to suppose that such a man, however non-political, will fall back into the primitive slough. And I think that such an answer [37] would be reasonable. But it leaves untouched my deepest objection to the whole theory. There still remains one point in which the society which Lenin anticipates will bear a fatal resemblance to primitive society. It will be one in which the collective will of the group or herd completely dominates over the individual. Lenin is quite explicit on this point. Instead of an army we shall have the force of the armed masses as a whole. Instead of the machinery of justice we shall have the immediate pressure of public disapproval. As Lenin says, justice will be done \u201cby the armed nation itself as simply and as readily as any crowd of civilised people, even in modern society, parts a pair of combatants or does not allow a woman to be outraged.\u201d I admit that there is a certain attraction about this ideal. But who does not see that it opens the way to a tyranny far harsher than that of any oriental despot? I waive the obvious objection that the genuine criminal works in secret and that we should therefore still need some machinery of detection. The thing goes far deeper. Our experience of savage societies, or of petty non political societies such as we find in public schools or army messes, shows us what this direct power of the herd really leads to. The savage is the least free of all men: every act of his life is hemmed round by rigid conventions: his marriages, his food, his dress, his language, his methods of eating or spitting, every trivial form of behaviour is dictated by immemorial custom: the least sign of variation is ruthlessly suppressed as \u201cunclean \u201c or \u201cunholy\u201d or \u201cunlucky.\u201d In some of the West African tribes a woman who is guilty of the eccentricity of bearing twins is ostracised and the twins killed. In Thibet  it is unholy to eat with the left hand. In some societies one must wash only in running water: in others only in standing water. We see the same principle at work in the society of a school \u2013 the childhood of the individual being a true image of the childhood of the race. In a school, as in the African jungle, the herd dictates all and the individual must obey. The schoolboy can seldom choose whether he is to part his hair in the middle or at the side, whether he is to wear boots or shoes, whether he is to use certain slang expressions or certain others, whether he is to walk on the footpath or in the road. In both cases \u2013 the savage tribe and the boy-tribe \u2013 we have a working model of the pure non-political society in which the blind instincts of the human pack are allowed to have their way. I am not suggesting that these herd instincts always work badly: it is indeed a matter of pure chance how they work. They may enjoin what is really good and forbid what is really bad, and they may equally well do the opposite. But whatever they do, they do blindly. It is true, as Lenin supposes, that the crowd may interfere to part two combatants: but only if the whim takes it. It may equally well form a ring to watch them; or take sides till the whole tribe is in an uproar: or simply knock one of the combatants on the head if he happens to be unpopular \u2013 though his unpopularity may be based only on the colour of his socks or a cold manner of speech. The direct action of the herd is only another name for what used to be called mob-law, which is [38] the expression of the mob mind. But we know, as a matter of psychology, what the mob mind is. We know that [it] is generally more stupid, more cruel and more aimless than the mind of the worst individual in the mob. A crowd swayed by panic or by anger will behave worse than perhaps any one member of that crowd would have behaved alone. There is no mystery about this. The collective spirit of the herd is just the survival of the non-human element in man: the instinctive, animal basis showing through under his specifically human and rational variation. The transition from animal to man is the transition from blind collective herd action, to intelligent action by the individual. The history of man\u2019s emergence from savagery is the history of the individual\u2019s gradual release from the pressure of the herd. Through the individual comes all advance, all knowledge, wisdom, justice and nobility: through the herd comes the resistance, the drag. The martyr who is burned for his own private and reasoned convictions is the type of the individual: the mob that burns him, not understanding itself nor him,but conscious only of a blind impulse, is the type of the herd. I am not pretending, of course, that the herd spirit is in a perpetual state of panic or fury: on the contrary its rare moments of excitement only punctuate a steady level of stagnation. But when it is most quiet it is most insidious. Even now, while it is still in chains, we can see it at work in every club and every street. We can see it in the sway of fashion \u2013 the blind impulse which drives the herd to wear the same clothes and read the same books this year which they will throw aside next year: we can see it in the contempt and dislike of the crowd for all who do not conform: in the disinterested hatred of the average unregenerate human animal for all that he stigmatises as \u201chighbrow\u201d and knows by instinct to be out of reach: in the dogmatic athleticism of our schools: in the carping criticism and finger pointed at every man who walks his own way. We have all at times felt the fingers of the herd itching to be at us. The drunken subaltern who prefers fox trots to civilised music hates me at heart for not sharing his preference: my Irish friends are angry that I have acquired some English pronunciations. They would all like to make us conform. At best the herd spirit moves at the pace of the slowest members in the herd. By its nature it hates all that is pre-eminent. The brute in man recognizes its natural enemy in every individual who would possess his own soul in private and be free from the pressure of his fellows. It is said that if you tie a scarlet rag about a chicken\u2019s foot the other chickens will peck it to death for being different: there is the essence of the herd spirit.<br/><br/>Here then lies the whole failure, for me, of Lenin\u2019s theory. To reach the non-political society in which the herd shall be all in all is, in effect, to dehumanize man: to return him to the condition of the gregarious animals, to elevate the pack above the individual and dethrone reason in favour of instinct. The state, even at its worst, is the preferable alternative of the two: if, at least, it is better to be an unhappy man than a happy sheep. The state [39] always implies the dominance of the conscious reason of the individual over the mere instincts of the collective mass. It may be a dominance of one class over others guided by selfish cunning and cruelly exercised: but so long as the individual, not the collective instinct, is at the helm there will be some freedom and some hope for the future. In the herd-life there is no room for advance and no freedom, for the first signs of individual development will be ruthlessly repressed.<br/><br/>And if Lenin\u2019s goal is thus undesirable the steps which he proposes to take towards that goal are even more so. What are we to say of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat, the revolutionary state which is to \u201cwither away\u201d? Firstly, that neither abstract probability nor the actual history of the Russian revolution encourages [us] to believe in the withering away process. Nor can we attach much importance to Lenin\u2019s theory of the miraculous simplification which will reduce all officials in the Communist state to the level of post office clerks and dispense with developed bureaucracy. Such a theory is typical of the herd\u2019s dislike of all that is pre-eminent. The average man has only an average intellect and he believes that all necessary work can be done by such an intellect. He believes that we have no need for talents which he does not possess and skill which he  cannot acquire. The result of applying this theory in practice has been to reduce a large empire to a condition of famine, without in reality keeping the officials any closer to the people than they are elsewhere. As to the despotism of the Proletariat over all other classes, it might at the first flush seem to be more just than the despotism of the Capitalists. If we must have a ruling class, why should it not be the largest class. In fact, however, the despotism of the Proletariat has proved less just, less intelligent and less merciful than any previous despotism and we can see why it must always do so. Where the few are masters and the many serve, the numbers on one side will always to some extent counterbalance and check the power on the other. A ruling class which is in the minority must observe some limits: even in absolute monarchy, as Dr. Johnson observed, if the king is too oppressive the people will rise up and cut his head off. When the positions are re-versed, when the many are masters, this check is removed. The Proletarian despotism has nothing to fear: it is the only perfect tyranny. Yet again, when the few rule, they rule by merit of some sort: some pre-eminence, though it were only of cunning or physical strength, they must have to enable to lead the many headed beast in harness. But the many, in the nature of things, have no claim but their numbers: they represent merely the dead level \u2013 the average human mudflat. What hope is there that they whose very claim is that they have no outstanding power of brain nor goodness of heart, should learn to rule justly or even to guard their own interests. Mixed with other elements in a democratic constitution they may have their use: erected into a privileged class it is impossible that they should bring forth other fruits than those of misery and confusion. I am not, [40] of course, defending existing conditions: justice and prudence may demand a drastic alteration in social life. But no alteration that leads to the Dictatorship of the Proletariat can lead to happiness. A despotism exercised without restraint by those who owe their power to  no single desirable quality of mind or spirit and whose very Shibboleth is to be undistinguished must by its nature be too stupid to rule, too selfish to abdicate and too weak to resist external aggression.",type:"Prose",notes:null},{title:"\u201cMythonomy\u201d fragment (1924)",printedIn:"Charlie W.

The first Zeus is above the human struggle, the second, simply outside it. Neither of them has anything to do with time. But Odin is a spirit rooted in time. He waits for the twilight of the gods. He has no true immortality, only longevity: no one ever thought of him as young. This seriousness of mortality raises him above the frivolous Zeus, while the mortal limitation depresses him below the Zeus of Phidias.  And being in time, he is also in the struggle. He has descended into Hel, been tortured between two fires, hung on the tree Ygdrasil, starved, grown grey, and lost an eye. If we look for his parallel in the Greek stories we shall find it not in the \u201ceasily living\u201d gods but rather in the resourceful, stubborn, hard-bitten Ulysses.

Yet the same children, if they are not exceptional or precocious, might become dumb, or lose half their virtue, if they were told to cease guessing and \u201cmake up\u201d a story instead.

I am assuming that Scripture supplies the data for theology \u2013 the \u201chard facts\u201d with which all theories must square \u2013 just as sense experience (aided by instruments and forced by experiments to be unequivocal) supplies the data for the physical sciences. But this, you say, implies a view of Scripture which most theologians have ceased to hold. You believe that, if pressed, it will turn out to involve inerrancy, and miraculous purity of the text, and literal interpretation of the text; in a word, Fundamentalism. And so we shall be back at \u201cproof-texts\u201d and \u201ctext-hunting\u201d and all the rest of it. And do I really want that?<br/><br/>Well, no, I don\u2019t. One of my reasons for disbelieving in literal inspiration is that this theory is contradicted by Scripture itself. The opening sentence of St. Luke tells us explicitly that he got his facts by inquiry, in a purely human and natural fashion. And I disbelieve in the inerrancy of Scripture because there are contradictions in the historic parts. What is more important, the Bible contains compositions which don\u2019t even offer themselves as records of fact. Anyone who is a critic at all \u2013 I don\u2019t mean a \u201cHigher Critic\u201d, but a real critic, a man with some feeling for literature \u2013 sees at once that Jonah or Esther is not even trying to be the same kind of thing as the accounts of David\u2019s court, or Acts. Job is the clearest example. He has no genealogy. He lives in a country we know nothing about, at a wholly undefined period. He has no existence apart from the main story, drags with him into light none of those <i>uninteresting</i> details which always accompany a historical person. \u201cOnce upon a time\u201d is writ large over the whole book.<br/><br/>So far I go with the Modernists \u2013 but indeed also with St. Jerome and Calvin \u2013 and against the Fundamentalists. But I differ from the former in three ways.<br/><br/>Firstly, I have no <i>a priori</i> disbelief in the miraculous and have never yet heard any argument which convinced me that I should. A modernist would think a passage unhistorical because it contained a miracle: I would gauge the probable or improbable historicity of the miracle by the general character of the narrative in which it occurred. Thus Job is for me unhistorical for the reasons I\u2019ve just given; not because it ends with a theophany.<br/><br/>The second difference is really a generalised form of the first. I do not bring to the reading of the Bible \u2013 nor, for that matter, of Homer, Aeschylus, Aristotle, or <i>Beowulf</i> \u2013 the assumption that our modern \u201coutlook on life\u201d is simply right and that the only valuable elements in any ancient book are those which win our immediate sympathy. I go to the past to broaden my mind, not to confirm my homebred opinions. I think every age has its blind spots and its special insights, and the present is merely a period like any other. In every age the Father of Lights and the Father of Lies are both at work. This perhaps explains my view of the miraculous. I know as well as you that ancient men easily thought they had seen it where it was not; I think it equally probable that we should fail to see if it were present. The \u201creal world\u201d for every age is in a large measure something selectively built out of the chaos of raw experience.<br/><br/>Thirdly and with all respect for the men themselves, I am profoundly sceptical about what they call Higher Criticism. I learned my scepticism from the reviews of my own books and books by my friends. You will laugh, but wait a moment. The author of a book is certainly the worst judge of any praise or censure it receives. But you would hardly believe how often only a small part of a review is taken up with either one or the other. Most of it may be engaged in trying to do to your book what the Higher Critics try to do to the books of the Bible; that is, to write a history of its composition  \u2013 when, with what intentions, how, under what influences, with what resources, you wrote it. Now of this, the author is not only the best but the final judge. What the critics guess at, he knows; can\u2019t help knowing. And can you guess how often I have found such imaginary histories of my own books correct? I believe I could conscientiously say, Never. I am sure I can say, Seldom. Friendly, hostile, moderate reviewers can be equally wrong.<br/><br/>Yet consider how easy their work was compared with that of the Higher Critic. They were dealing with a contemporary; a man who wrote and thought in their own language; educated as they were, exposed to all the same influences; perhaps personally known to them. A man of their own trade (for reviewers are usually authors). The Higher Critic has none of these advantages. In addition, he has often become a higher Critic without troubling just to become a critic, without acquiring a good nose for the differences between myth, legend, fiction, history, and reportage. He may also be a man who has never written, and never attempted to write, anything like the books he is discussing.<br/><br/>These considerations have been of immense use to me in my own studies. Let no one trouble me again with a new story of how <i>Piers Plowman</i> or <i>The Faerie Queene</i> was written. All labour lost. I cannot help also concluding that what the Higher Critic claims to know about the composition of certain sacred texts cannot really be discovered. Most of their work, I fancy, will presently rank with the other strange dreams men have had about the Bible; with the medieval allegorisations or the Puritan attempt to find in it a pattern of church government.<br/><br/>From all this, I suppose you may conclude that I attach to the Bible a kind and degree of value which would not satisfy the Fundamentalist and would go a good deal too far for Vidler. Like him, I believe in the guidance of the Holy Spirit. But I could not, like him, trust that guidance for the future if I thought that nearly everything which had seemed to come from it in the past was now found to be erroneous, so that the whole intertwined history of Bible, Church, and individual religious experience can be set aside wherever we meet a difficulty. What would such a view imply? That we, being holier and wiser and more abundant in sufferings than the prophets, apostles, martyrs, and doctors of the past, were more receptive? Or that the Holy Spirit had now learned better how to guide us?<br/><br/>I don\u2019t, do I, need to say that Scripture is <i>the</i> datum? But surely, at least one of the data? Let the tradition of the Church, and the agreement between dissentient churches, the experiences of great saints, the teachings of great doctors, be  all the data. It is someone\u2019s job, perhaps, to sort them out into a strict order of precedence. I don\u2019t think it is mine. I am content to say that the more of these data any theology can reconcile, the stronger it will be. In every other discipline, after all, reckless jettison is a sign of weakness. In dealing with a crux from Sophocles or Shakespeare the worst critic is he who just throws up the sponge by saying, \u201cThis is corrupt\u201d. There are corruptions; not so many as a bad scholar thinks.

If the enclosed notes help at all, use them as you see fit. I like your Contact Club and wish it all the best.<br/><br/>Yours sincerely<br/>C.S. Lewis<br/><br/>I am out of touch with the whole direction given to the debate from the outset. Unless we are wishful thinkers, what we want to know about \u201cRationalism\u201d and \u201cReligion\u201d is not which (if either) will make us happy but which (if either) is true.<br/><br/>The word <i>Rationalism</i> has two meanings. (A) The etymological sense: the determined practice of reason. (B) Historically, the name given in the nineteenth century to that school of thought which denied the supernatural. We all alike claim to be rationalistic in sense A. The debate is between those who think that reason leads to \u201cRationalism\u201d in sense A and those who do not. It would be safer to describe it as a debate between Naturalism and Supernaturalism.<br/><br/>The case against Naturalism is briefly this:<br/><br/>1. When any particular thought is known to be the result of irrational causes it is discounted: e.g. when we know that I think this dog is dangerous <i>because</i> I have a complex about black dogs, no one attaches any value to my opinion.<br/><br/>2. If each individual thought is discounted for having irrational causes, then, should <i>thought in general</i> be shown to have irrational causes, thought in general must be equally discredited.<br/><br/>3. Now Naturalism asserts that human thought is due to the movement of atoms in the brain, etc., i.e. to irrational causes.<br/><br/>4.\tTherefore if Naturalism is true, all thought is discredited. But Naturalism is itself a thought. Therefore Naturalism is discredited.i.e. Naturalism cuts off the branch it is sitting on. The belief that the human mind is simply a part of that irrational total we call Nature is quite inconsistent with those claims for our reason which Naturalists (like all other thinkers) make.<br/><br/>5. Put this another way. My reason is either a product of Nature or it is not. If it is, then it is a by-product of natural selection, \u201cselected,\u201d not because its logic yields truth but because its mental habits have \u201csurvival value\u201d for mating and food hunting. What reason have we then to suppose that when applied beyond immediate practical matters they will yield truth? But the whole Naturalistic philosophy (atoms, nebulae, paleontology, evolution, matter itself) is precisely such an application \u201cbeyond immediate practical matters.\u201d <i>On its own premises,</i> therefore, there is no reason to believe it true. If, on the other hand, my reason is not a product of Nature, then something other than Nature, the extra- or supernatural, exists.<br/><br/>6. The great argument <i>for</i> Naturalism is, I admit, the limitless cruelty and injustice of Nature. But oddly enough the moment we say this, we are really denying that Nature is all. For \u201cThis is unjust\u201d is a moral judgment (M.J.). Now my M.J. is itself either a product of Nature or not. If it is how can I at the same moment trust my M.J. and condemn that Nature which, on this assumption, has doled my M.J. out to me? Seeing the <i>source</i> to be senseless and detestable I ought of course equally to despise the M.J. which comes from it. In which case my condemnation must be abandoned. In reality, of course, at the moment of judging Nature to be bad I am (without noticing it) claiming to be something <i>outside</i> Nature. In fact I am really adopting the alternative hypothesis \u2013 that my M.J. does <i>not</i> come from Nature but from some higher reality. The more seriously and confidently you condemn Nature the more you are implying both that there is a Supernature and that you are in some way in touch with it.<br/><br/>7. If these positions are accepted it follows that Supernaturalism is really involved in the claim we daily make to be able to think at all. After seeing that, one might go on to investigate the usual accounts given of the supernatural. (It will save time to recognize that only <i>two</i> really matter: Hinduism and Christianity. Buddhism is a Hindu heresy and Islam is a Christian heresy. All the vital elements of Paganism, Platonism, Stoicism and Confucianism will be found either in Hinduism or Christianity or in both.)<br/><br/>8. On \u201cmystical experience\u201d: I wish I had a quite clear definition of the words. If one means \u201csupernatural experience\u201d (i.e. experience one couldn\u2019t have if one were a merely natural being) then we all have it whenever we think rationally. If it means supernatural stages of consciousness then the idea that an enquiry into religion should begin by trying to \u201cget a mystical experience\u201d before you have practiced the religious life seems to me like the idea that the study of geography should begin by trying to sail a ship to America before you\u2019ve learned navigation.<br/><br/>9. On Reason and Revelation: If the claim \u201cthere has been a revelation\u201d is in fact false, then no doubt the acceptance of the supposed revelation will usually involve errors in reasoning. But there is no opposition in principle between Reason and Revelation: for of course those who accept Revelation believe that Reason leads them to regard it <i>as</i> a Revelation. In fact, the relation between Reason and Revelation is like that between Reason and sense-experience: i.e. both supply Reason with materials which she cannot spin out of herself.<br/><br/>C.S.

I might go further and say that I am less interested in Courtly Love itself than most people suppose. My real concern was allegory and C. L. originally came in for the sake of studying allegory, not <i>vice-versa</i> as most people think. Temperamentally I find the phase of sexuality exhibited in C. L. <i>most uncongenial.</i> Any strength my book has results from the fact that it is the work of an outsider.*<br/><br/>I hope it is now clear that I have nothing to \u2018forgive\u2019.

Their content may be briefly analysed thus:\u2014 The poet, being unable to sleep, takes up his Boethius in the hope of finding it a soporific, but, growing interested, continues to read far into the night, and finally lays it aside only to reflect on the theme of fortune in general and his own fortune in particular. He is interrupted by the matins bell, which seems to say to him, \u201cTell on, man, quhat the befell.\u201d This determines him\u2014since he has already spent much paper in vain\u2014to make a new beginning. He therefore makes a cross in his manuscript and begins \u201chis book.\u201d There follow two stanzas on the dangers of youth, one in which he applies the previous two to his own youth, two more in which he compares the difficulties of his literary undertaking to those of a mariner becalmed by night, and a final stanza in which he invokes the Muses.<br/><br/>The problem is to find the connexion between this apparently rambling induction and the poem which actually follows. Skeat, in the introduction to his text (published for the E.E.T.S. in 1884), regards it as a slab of aimless poetizing composed <i>before</i> the King had seen Joan Beaufort and when he had \u201cno very clear idea as to what he was going to write about.\u201d The new work\u2014<i>i.e.,</i> the work written after he had fallen in love\u2014does not (for Skeat) begin until Stanza twenty-nine. We are to suppose that when James at last <i>had</i> found a theme he collected the several scraps of aimless verse previously composed and tacked them thus clumsily on to the beginning of his new poem. The obvious objection to this theory is contained in Stanza ten (\u201cIn tender youth how sche\u2014<i>i.e.,</i> Fortune\u2014was first my fo And eft my frende, and how I gat recur off my distresse\u201d)\u2014lines which must clearly have been written after the success of his suit to Joan Beaufort; and this objection Skeat disposes of by the supposition that these lines were added later, as also the passage in Stanza nineteen (\u201cMy turment and my ioye\u201d). It will be noticed that both passages involve rime-words, and that it is therefore a question not of the lines themselves but of the whole stanzas in which they occur. Gregory Smith (in Chapter X. of the Cambridge \u2018History of English Literature,\u201d Vol. II.), while rightly protesting against Skeat\u2019s rather drastic surgery, and stating that the poem is a unity, does not explain how that unity manifests itself in the passage we are considering.<br/><br/>I venture to suggest that the difficulty all arises from the fact that the reader, blinded by the history of James as a <i>man,</i> approaches his induction determined to see in it some reference to that history; but when once we have grasped that James is here speaking not of his history as a man but of his history as a <i>poet,</i> the whole thing becomes clear. Stanzas one to thirteen are an introduction which describes the genesis of the poem. The author tells us he took up Boethius one sleepless night. (It will be noted that it was neither his love nor his imprisonment that kept him awake. Cf. Stanza two: \u201cCan I nought say quharfore.\u201d If we must assume that cares hinder sleep, they were the cares of a poet.) Boethius suggested the idea of Fortune, which inevitably suggested the curious fortunes of his own life\u2014some months ago a lonely prisoner, now an accepted lover soon to return, a free man, with his bride, to Scotland. At this point the matins bell rang and a new idea occurred to him. He had already wanted much paper in the effort to write a Chaucerian poem, but had made little progress. Suddenly\u2014so suddenly that it needed only the slightest conceit to identify the suggestion with the actual sound of the bell\u2014it flashed upon him that his own life provided a capital theme for the sort of poem he had been trying to write. A moment later he would have been seeing how well the circumstances of his falling in love could be worked up on lines of the \u201cKnight\u2019s Tale.\u201d Having thus seen where his real task lay\u2014namely, in using the framework of the allegorical poem for the expression of a personal and actual emotion\u2014he realized that his literary development had entered on a new phase. In fine, the first thirteen stanzas of the \u201cKingis Quair\u201d correspond almost exactly to Sidney\u2019s first sonnet, and the words \u201cTell on, man, quhat the befell\u201d are James\u2019s version of \u201cLook in thy heart and write.\u201d (In a modern author the matter of these thirteen stanzas would probably go into a prose preface.) At Stanza fourteen the poem proper begins. The author, after referring to the weakness of youth in general and of his own youth in particular, goes on with a modesty not unusual in medieval poets to express vividly (17 and 18) the sense of his unfitness for the arduous work he has in hand, but finally plucks up courage to invoke the Muses. I would, therefore, divide as follows: (1) Stanzas one to thirteen, autobiographical preface describing the <i>literary</i> genesis of the poem; (2) Stanzas fourteen to nineteen, formal induction to the poem proper, with moral reflections, modest hesitations, and invocation <i>en regle;</i> (3) Stanzas twenty to twenty-eight, first step in the narrative, describing his life previous to the love affair with Joan Beaufort. After this the poem needs no explanation.<br/><br/>Only those who forget the tendency of young poets to write about poetry itself and the intense feelings which they suffer in connexion with their own poetical progress will think that such a purely literary adventure as I describe is too slight a theme for these stanzas. James himself supplies the answer to such objections. If Stanza seventeen had survived alone out of this poem, would not criticism have supposed that these pathetic lines referred to the author\u2019s misery as a prisoner, or, at least, as a lover? Yet we see from Stanza eighteen that the \u201crokkis\u201d are only those of \u201cprolixitee\u201d and the \u201clak of wynd\u201d is only \u201cthe deficultee in enditing.\u201d<br/><br/>Magdalen College, Oxford.<br/>C.S.

M. Gray traces to Spenser\u2019s experiences of the Irish wars certain passages in the <i>Faerie Queene</i> where knights are represented in conflict with a \u201crascal many\u201d of robbers, cannibals and other rabble. The purpose of this letter is not to deny Mr. Gray\u2019s thesis. On the main issue I am disposed to agree with him. But there is one argument in his article \u2212 an argument which he merely throws out as a buttress and which it would be unfair to press if my purpose were controversial \u2212 that I would venture to criticise. We read on p. 414 that \u201cin so far as this poem (sc. <i>The Faerie Queene</i>) was a tale of knight errantry, Spenser followed in the main the example of Malory and of the medieval romance writers, but into the adventures of the knights he introduces a new kind.\u201d Again (p. 415), \u201cNeither Malory nor any of his predecessors in romance provide a precedent for the type of episode in which hordes of savages rush out of the mountains and forests \u2026in medi\xe6val romance the knight rarely encounters the \u2018rascal many.\u2019\u201d As against this I would plead, \u201cIn so far as this poem was a romantic epic, Spenser followed in the main the examples of Boiardo and Ariosto; and in Boiardo (I do not answer for Ariosto) he found precedent for the type of episode in which knights are attacked by a rabble of robbers or cannibals.\u201d<br/><br/>[84]If it were necessary at this time of day to prove Spenser\u2019s familiarity with Boiardo, a single quotation would suffice.<br/><br/><i>F.Q.</i> III, iii, 26. But that he by an Elfe was gotten of a Fay.<br/><i>Orlando Innamorato,</i> III, ii, 46. Che d\u2019una fata nacque e d\u2019un folletto.<br/><br/>In such an allowed matter, however, it will save time to proceed at once to those scenes of attack by a \u201crabble\u201d which are in question.<br/><br/><i>O.I.</i> II, xix, 16 <i>et seq.</i>, Brandimarte, journeying unarmed with Fiordelisa, hears a robbers\u2019 scout summoning his companions and is forced to fly until he finds a dead king in the forest, whose sword he takes.

Even the \u201cvillein\u201d in Spenser who seems to be slain and then rises again to [85] fight with Arthur (<i>F.Q.</i> II, xi, 35) finds his parallel in Boiardo\u2019s Orrilo (<i>O.I.</i> III, ii, 48 <i>et seq.</i>).<br/><br/>I have already said that I am not trying to refute Mr. Gray\u2019s thesis. The differences between Spenser and Boiardo in these passages are as important as the similarities, and those differences can well be explained as the product of Spenser\u2019s Irish experiences. My own concern in the matter is to combat the idea that \u201cMalory and his predecessors\u201d are the main source of Spenser\u2019s episodes. Is it not rather a canon of Spenserian <i>Quellenforschung:</i> \u201cNever look further for the source of a passage until you have satisfied yourself that it does not come out of the Italian epics\u201d?<br/><br/>Yours faithfully,<br/>C.S.

As a citizen, I submit that the members of the Home Guard made a voluntary sacrifice of their leisure at a time when the country was in extreme danger. Since then their service has been made compulsory and their leisure further encroached upon. Both these evils are borne with patience because they are taken as necessary evils. But what shadow of right can the State pretend for using the power it has thus acquired over them to compel them to go to church? Or in what spirit are we to suppose that a man who has lost his Sunday morning for an object which he understands and approves will see his Sunday evening also taken from him for an object which was never even mentioned when he first became a Home Guard? As a Christian, I submit that such interferences with the private life of the Home Guard are calculated to harden ordinary English indifference into fierce anticlericalism of the Continental type. Angry men do not reason clearly. They will transfer to the Church itself the resentment they justly feel for the busy-body who has marched them to it. Some of them no doubt are Christians. But why should a Christian by entering the Home Guard be deprived of the right to go to the church and service he chooses with his own wife and children, or be forced to the difficult exercise of praying amidst a crowd of comrades either bitterly resentful or (worse still) contemptuously patient? War demands compulsions; all the more reason to guard against gratuitous compulsions which it does not demand.

I venture to leave on my table for more than 24 hours, and disappeared. <i>Did</i> you say anything in it about the young lady who wants lodging \u2013 the one about whom you wrote to Mrs. Moore yesterday? I can\u2019t remember a word on <i>that</i> subject. At any rate that\u2019s alright. A Mrs. Dodwell (Marcia is her Christian name, tho\u2019 it seems incredible) of Southernmay, Dunston Rd. Old Headington writes to say that she has found the girl a room. The rest of your letter, she bears and all, I do remember \u2013 if it was the rest and not the whole. (For I was feeling as Johnson did about Burke \u201cif I were to see Harwood now it would kill me\u201d.) As usual I can only thank you and wish I <i>could</i> come. Never fulfil the threat you once made of ceasing to ask me because I have so often refused. I live in the expectation of being some day a freer man and better friend: but not now. You know what driving an old car is like \u2013 the <i>normal</i> running becomes more and more abnormal and there is always a semi-crisis. My family life is like that: no-one\u2019s fault \u2013 just old age and the change in society wh. is depriving our own class of its \u201cchoreigia.\u201d In other words, by the time my arm is out of a sling and I am able to face the journey (I couldn\u2019t at present) it will be high time for me to make myself useful at home: my prolonged status of \u201cpassenger\u201d has already thrown heavy burdens on others. Thank Daphne a thousand times. Hospitality has in these days risen from the rank of courtesy to that of heroic virtue and I never knew anyone who had it in a higher degree. As to why my arm is in a sling \u2013 apparently when you remove a foreign body wh. has been so long naturalised, you sometimes get a \u201c flare-up\u201d of all the latent poison. I go to Acland every day and have prongs stuck into it and the matter squeezed out of it. Don\u2019t pity me too much. The process looks revolting but, oddly enough, hurts no more than a lover\u2019s pinch. Nor is there apparently any danger to the arm. As for the stone which was removed from under my tongue, you will be pleased to hear that it must have impeded my speech all these years. So there\u2019s a good time coming. No more will you complain of that taciturnity wh. your kindness so often led you to attribute to modesty. No more will you whisper to Barfield after my rare remarks \u201cIf only he\u2019d talk more.\u201d (This reminds me of one of only two good things I found in M. Ward\u2019s <i>Life of Chesterton,</i> viz: on being told \u201cOh Master Gilbert you\u2019ve got a little baby brother,\u201d G.K. replied \u201cNow I shall always have an audience.\u201d The other good reply was to an American who asked him \u201cSay, Mr. Chesterton, what makes women talk so much?\u201d He answered, \u201cGod, Madam.\u201d But a dull book on the whole.)<br/><br/>I also read Martin Chuzzlewit and the second half of the Aeneid. M.C. is almost my favourite Dickens because in it the melodramatic parts (remember Jonas\u2019s drive to Salisbury with the man he means to murder) are almost as good as the comic ones. Aeneid VII-XII is pure gold: specially VIII. Can you read all this? My writing is becoming no better than yours: partly because I have rheumatism in my right arm \u2013 that\u2019s the other arm. I\u2019m writing to Mrs. Dodwell as soon as I\u2019ve finished this. What do you think of Kipling? I have to talk about him in the near future. Am I right in thinking that the essential thing about him is neither patriotism nor imperialism but professionalism \u2013 i.e. he\u2019s the first man who has expressed the snug freemasonry between people who share the same work and the same hardship and grievances \u2013 the delight of talking shop when \u201cwe\u201d are together and enjoy our unity against outsiders and also against the \u201ccubs\u201d and \u201cpups\u201d, the \u201cnew bugs\u201d in our own trade who aren\u2019t yet in the know. Up till Kipling fiction had been all about people\u2019s private lives: he first notices this immense vocational bond wh. is in some cases stronger than nationality, religion or family. The strength of his work comes from the fact that the thing he is talking about does really keep the \u201csystem of things\u201d running every 24 hours and is responsible for countless heroisms. The sinister side of his work is that he doesn\u2019t seem to know (or perhaps care) that it is also the <i>modus operandi</i> \u2013 nay, the very incarnation, of nearly all strong corruption and cruelty. I shd. very much like (as Pecksniff says) to see your ideas on this. I read your sonnet and \u201cLaura\u201d to my literary friends recently. The sonnet, tho\u2019 not misliked, was completely overshadowed by \u201cLaura\u201d wh. everyone admired. Barfield is writing good things at present. I must stop now and write to Marcia D.

Thus I cherish Daphne and Cecil with my prayers and speed them with my vows. For you there awaits\u2014I weary the shrines of the Gods (with my prayer that it be so)\u2014the sea\u2019s expansive smile and the paths of ocean tranquil in the light of the moon. May your sails be billowing even now with a lucky wind. The Isles of the Blest are in sight and through the pale night their beaches rustle sweetly beneath the impact of the slow withdrawing, greenly shining wave. Already you may see through the mist a lofty summit of grass and trees, may hear the whispering of the foliage of the forests of the Hesperides: where golden apples weigh down their branches, where the nightingale with her melodious voice sings and will be singing. Ceaseless, for all time; where winters do not destroy flowers, or heat scorch the grass.<br/><br/>Here, as they tell, it is permitted to a few, who are guided by smiling Venus and Saturnian Juno, whose faith is inviolate, and who are wise in their dealings with the world. Here it is allowed them to divert their wearied barque through shallows loud with the songs of Sirens, and no-one forbids it. What is not lawful to virgins and learned poets? Here it is right to disembark, here it is right for once to pace with mortal feet immortal ground and to visit the groves of the blest and approach the fountains of the everlasting gods, though creatures of a day. Perchance in you too a solemn amazement may [48] arise, as you bethink you: The sea, the air, the star-studded vault of heaven are still in place: the wayfarings of sun and moon go on, and the fruitful year passes through season to season. Why does not the Moon leap drunken from the sky, seeking her fair Endymion? How comes it that the fiery Earth does not ravish the loves of the dying Heavens and scatter them in pregnant ruins? What! The laws of nature abide unchanged? Everything going on as usual? Do they behold our joy?<br/><br/>O sacred powers! All motion is born of love (or Venus). Desperately the parched earth loves the dew, the river, the ocean, the sky. So Form loves willing Matter, and day loves night; so the indwelling spirit loves the friendly body, God loves man, and pleasure loves tears. And within such a furnace, such a maelstrom of love, the mechanism of the breathing world, calmly relying on its proper forces, remains inviolate.<br/><br/>Only be ye not unmindful of an old friend.
