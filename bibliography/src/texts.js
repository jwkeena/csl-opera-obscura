The days are long past when the mighty man of arms, the Goliath, the Aeneas, was the prop and pillar of his fatherland. Physical development matters little now a days on the battlefield and nothing at all in politics. The successful football player or cricket player achieves no material benefit for the country he supports. The Scholar on the other hand not only furnishes and improves his own mind, but also by the instruction he may impart, and the discoveries to which his learning may lead, benefits and glorifies his fellow beings. ...Doubtless there are many persons—and more particularly amongst my own class—schoolboys—who would regard what I have been writing as rankert treason against an athletic code to which they demand conformity from all: there are those, believe me, who in England will become next summer engaged in a dangerous and even unequal war, [who] would still follow the doings of our cricket team in Australia with more interest than those of our army in the hostile land. ...They should not blind themselves to the fact that athletic success is transitory, and will bear them no help when they are turned adrift in the world: learning, however, is everlasting and will always stand them in good stead. ...Let it not however be inferred from what I said, that I condemn the pursuit of athletics: far be it from me to oppose this healthy means of recreation. ...But while allowing that the pursuit of athletics is a wholesale—nay, a necessary pastime—one cannot lose sight of the mistakes and wrong ideas arising from an exaggerated estimation of their value.",

        textProvided: "[Book One, 11]<br>ARGUMENT. A boy brought up from childhood to fear God more than to love Him, and to fear Hell more than God, thereby learns at least to acknowledge duties which he cannot perform and to remember death. All unconnected with this teaching are the fits of strange Desire, which haunt him from his earliest years, for something that cannot be named; something which he can describe only as ‘Not this,’ ‘Far farther,’ or ‘Yonder.’ As puberty approaches, the senses claim to have discovered what the object of this Desire really is, but do not keep their promise; and in the moment of his lowest disillusion the true Desire returns in all its force.<br><br>[Book Two (wrongly captured as Book One: The Data), 31]<br>ARGUMENT. He begins his education, gathers stray scraps of popular science, and delightedly abandons his religion. His moral ideals, freed from their association with reward and punishment stand out more clearly than before; his reverence for them, though not his obedience to them, is increased. Romantic poetry takes possession of him, and the aesthetic life now claims that it will show him the object of his Desire. But it also breaks its promise. Ecstasy dwindles into mere pleasure, and in that pleasure the disguised erotic element soon reveals itself. He piques himself on seeing through adolescent illusions (as he now calls them) and adopts cynical modernity.<br><br>[Book Three, 51]<br>ARGUMENT. He enters advanced coteries and tries the literature of the contemporary ‘movement,’ exposing to its outrages whatever is wholesome in his sensibility or clear in his thinking. Psycho-analysis, and the outlook popularly based on it, begin to imprison his mind. He now believes that his mysterious Desire was never anything but a mask for lust, and that all systems save materialism are wish-fulfilment dreams. But his critical faculties reawaken before this condition of mind becomes permanent. He finds that the ‘worm’s-eye view,’ when challenged, defends itself by jargon.<br><br>[Book Four, 73]<br>ARGUMENT. He learns to think for himself, and at the same moment the Desire revisits him. He sees that the doctrine of the wish-fulfilment dream does not prove all the things it seemed to prove. But with this discovery comes another—that Christianity cannot be a wish-fulfilment dream. Whose wishes does it fulfil? Certainly not his, for the notion that the religion of his childhood might after all be true is still his chief, though repressed, terror. Acutely uneasy, he abandons speculative thought in a panic.<br><br>[Book Five, 87]<br>ARGUMENT. He returns to an attempt at living according to his moral ideals. He knows that Christianity promises assistance in this attempt but refuses (through fear) to examine the question; and though his conscience invites him to higher endeavours, he embraces a ‘common-sense’ ideal of cultured, humane, enlightened hedonism. Such an ideal, however has no room for the Desire that still haunts him; he is disgusted at its heartlessness; and he discovers that its plausibility depends on externals. It is a philosophy that takes for granted a comfortable income and a good digestion.<br><br>[Book Six, 115]<br>ARGUMENT. The collapse of ‘common sense’ drives him on to the harder and severer systems of our own day. He glances at Anglo-Catholicism, Humanism, and Classicism: at the world, in fine, of Messrs. Irving Babbitt, T.S. Eliot, Santayana, the Criterion, etc. But no compromise is possible between their world and the Desire which is still the motive of all his thoughts. Finally he tries the hardest and severest of all—‘Nordic’ Fascism and Marxian Communism. Their asceticism attracts his conscience: but in each he discovers behind the heroic facade a genuine recrudescence of primeval cruelty and a rejection, along with the humane, of the human itself.<br><br>[Book Seven, 137]<br>ARGUMENT. His conscience is now paralysed. The will to do good remains, but no ‘good’ can be found to do. Abandoning the moral view of life, he yields to his wishes and explores philosophies less jejune than those that have lately occupied him. From ‘broad-church’ modernist Christianity (which turns out in practice to be little more than a kindlier version of common sense and its fair-weather optimism) he rapidly passes to philosophical idealism. Here at last he finds a rational account both of his nameless Desire and of his moral obligations: but he finds also that this system never remains operative for long in any mind without unacknowledged support from other quarters. The Hegelians of the right draw their real strength from Christianity, those of the left from Communism. Those who do neither are merely professional philosophers—college tutors whose real life is on the golf-links or at the bridge-table.<br><br>[Book Eight, 173]<br>ARGUMENT. He attempts to become a real Monist. His conscience compels him to accept, for practice, the ascetic interpretation of this creed. As soon as it is brought to the test of action, the distinction (which he had hoped to maintain) between the Absolute of philosophy and the God of religion becomes confused. He finds that he is praying: he is assisted by Divine Grace. Increasing historical knowledge lays bare the true relations between Paganism, Judaism, and Christianity. He is not allowed any longer to doubt that his Desire, and his moral conscience, are both the voice of God.<br><br>[Book Nine, 209]<br>ARGUMENT. He struggles to escape, but finally submits his will to that of God revealed in Christianity.<br><br>[Book Ten, 225]<br>ARGUMENT. The old Desire (now known for what it is) returns to him in its fullness; but there is no mystical or ecstatic short cut to fruition. He must begin common life again from the beginning, and learn obedience and wisdom by reapproaching all the old problems under better guidance, till, at last, he becomes as a little child.",

        textProvided: "THE poetry of <i>Fox,</i> which is now to be considered, is more simple and unadorned than that of any other writer; nor need it excite the wonder of posterity if the regularity of nature and the sobriety of reason were not sufficient to save his compositions from disgust in an age when taste was formed on the incoherent excursions of <i>Eliot</i> and the petulant obscurity of <i>Pound</i>. But since the modes of error are agitated by continual change while truth remains always the same, his poetry now shines with undiminished lustre when the false wit of the Fantasticks is neglected by the polite, condemned by the judicious, and read by the learned with frigid indifference.<br><br>It does not appear that he formed his style, like <i>Wordsworth,</i> upon any philological system, or was guided to plainness of diction and justness of sentiment by any principles but those of his own genius. <i>Natvilcius</i> tells us that as Fox appears in his poetry, so he was in his conversation, and that in correcting the verses of his friends he invariably amputated exuberances and moderated enthusiasm: yet such was the sweetness of his address and the ease of his manners that we hear of no resentment inflamed and no friendship broken by this <i>Draconian</i> severity.<br><br>That he who sacrificed to the Muses with such parsimony sometimes solicited their kindness in vain, only panegyrical criticism will deny. If his poetry never disgusts us by the vacuity of affectation or the tremour of disproportionate splendour, it sometimes chills us with imbecility and avoids excellences as well as faults. Yet he has left no poem which does not please as a whole. He always performs more than he promises. The reader who at first expected only amusement finds himself insensibly transported, and wonders at last by what stealth a composition which seems to owe so little to art has afforded him so much pleasure and so much instruction.<br><br>The most considerable of his performances is the <i>King Coel,</i> a work which some have reproached as deficient in the unity of action. It must be allowed that the events related in the last book are not otherwise connected with the principal action of the poem than as they concern some of the same persons: but this is a fault which critical science discovers in vain while the common reader is content to be pleased. Others have enquired whether the poem be a just <i>epick,</i> an <i>epyllion,</i> or an <i>idyll;</i> but of disputes determinable by no appeal to reason or experience and originating only in the fury of nomenclature, who shall be the arbiter? The fable is probable, and there are no machines unless the soporifick faculty of the boy <i>Rufus</i> be so designated; and this so far conforms to the precepts of the ancients that it performs nothing which could have been performed without it. In this poem <i>Fox</i> writes about the middle sort of men and things, leading us through scenes neither splendid nor sordid, neither plunging us into the vulgarity of daily occupations nor summoning us into the airy regions of the marvellous, and engaging our interest in persons whose vices are not flagitious as their vertues are not beyond irritation. The old king is not very wise: but there is in his character much of the pathetick and every reader feels a kindness towards him. The love passages were concerned in his own day for their coldness and still excite the merriment of the <i>French</i> criticks; but he who reads to learn what may rationally be felt and innocently enjoyed will prefer them to the cant of profligacy and fashion, to the frenzies of <i>Calpronede,</i> the impurities of <i>Freud,</i> and the bathos of <i>Dell</i>. <i>Constantius</i> offers such love as a soldier and a man of sense may be expected to feel, and is rewarded with such affection as the nature of things commonly allows men to inspire.<br><br>In the <i>Sacred Satire,</i> as the theme is more awful, the manner is more severe. The sentiments are just and every reader wonders how he himself, on such a subject, has missed them. The lyrical piece prefixed to the Satire is one of the most pleasing effusion of poetical piety.<br><br>So little were the merits of <i>Fox</i> perceived by his own age that his elevation to the Chair of Poetry in the University of Oxford is said to have excited wonder. By this event <i>Natvilcius</i> tells us that no rival was mortified and no faction embittered, because all confessed that the supporters of Fox had neither overawed resistance by the splendour of their names nor undermined it by policy; that they had won by mere numbers a contest in which numbers are the only lawful means of victory; and that they had enrolled these numbers by no subtler strategem than that of disseminating widely what they believed sincerely. It is pleasing to learn that when the taste of the town was so corrupt, the justice and candour of the University remained thus unimpaired. Such are the obliquities of our vitiated nature that in some ages those very qualities which <i>Natvilcius</i> allows to the <i>Foxites</i> will be found more likely to irritate than to allay the displeasure of an adversary; nor is it recorded that <i>Goliath</i> found any consolation in reflecting that he who slew him was a shepherd and a boy.",

Your reviewer asserts that if M. de Rougemont has proved his case (a question which he leaves open), it will then follow that I, while “supposing that I wrote as an orthodox member of the Church of England,” have in reality been “celebrating something anti-Christian.” In fact, though I did not, like M. de Rougemont, speculate about a possibly anti-Christian origin for courtly love, I attributed to it a certainly anti-Christian content, as the glorification of a mortal sin, adultery; and I am thought by real scholars to have even exaggerated this aspect of it. What is meant by “celebrating” I am not sure, but I suspect that your reviewer has fallen into the error of supposing that an historian approves <i>simpliciter</i> whatever he describes with some degree of interest and imaginative sympathy. I have never maintained that the original code of courtly love was compatible with Christian ethics. In my book I described the conversion which this original code underwent at the hands of the Italian and the English poets: and I assumed that the conversion was an improvement. But whether, even in its converted form, it is absolutely a good thing, is a question to which I do not claim to know the answer; and if I attempted to find the answer I should certainly begin by distinguishing the problem of origin from that of value. Finally, your reviewer misunderstands me if he thinks I believe that the “themes” of <i>Macbeth, Samson Agonistes, The Prelude, Alice in Wonderland</i> and <i>The Dynasts</i> are “derived from the Troubadours.”<br><br>Yours faithfully,<br><br>C.S.

The third and fourth defend the present course of English studies at Oxford against certain criticisms; but so differently (the one having been addressed to a joint meeting of the Classical and English Associations and the other to undergraduates) that I hope they do not much overlap. The fifth is partly a defence of the many popular books which have, I believe, so greatly increased my power of enjoying more serious literature as well as ‘real life’; but it is much more a defence of disinterested literary enjoyment in general against certain dangerous tendencies in modern education. I was afraid lest all the pleasant landscapes would soon be shut out by a wall of blackboards and ‘certificates’.

        textProvided: "MIRACLES<br><br>An Address by Mr. C.S. Lewis<br><br>On Sunday at St. Jude’s, Hampstead Garden Suburb, Mr. C.S. Lewis, author of <i>The Screwtape Letters,</i> gave an address after Evensong on “Miracles.” He said that he had only met one person who claimed to have seen a “ghost,” and she was a disbeliever in immortality, both before and after she had seen it. She said that it was an hallucination; and it might have been.<br><br>Seeing was not believing. That was one of the first things to note in regard to miracles. Our senses were not infallible. If a man held a philosophy which excluded the supernatural, he could always say that he had been the victim of an illusion. Miracles would appear to have diminished and ceased as materialism became the popular philosophy of Western Europe. If the materialist saw the Heavens roll up and the great white throne appear, he would not believe in the supernatural. Experience by itself proved nothing. The materialist might doubt whether he was waking or dreaming, and what could convince him that what he saw was not a dream? People said that their ancestors, taking the supernatural for granted, saw miracles where no miracles occurred. He thought it very likely that they did. But there was one thing which they simply must not say about their ancestors, and that was that they believed in miracles because they did not know about nature. When St. Joseph was minded to put away his bride, he knew the law of biology. When he heard the Christian explanation, he accepted it as a miracle. If people had no knowledge of the laws of nature, they would not recognize anything as a miracle. They could not think and act in a world of nature without claiming even for themselves a slightly supernatural status. They would find the world buzzing with the miraculous. History was full of it. Many a missionary would tell of miracles which he had seen happening. They would find that one set of people—the Church of Rome—claimed that miracles occurred quite often. Of course, most stories of miracles were unreliable, but most stories of all events were unreliable. What they must not do was to rule out the miraculous in advance as the one impossible explanation.<br><br><b>The Activity of God Through Creation</b><br><br>When the Old Testament said that Sennacherib’s invasion was put an end to by the Angel of the Lord, and Herodotus said that it was because an enormous number of mice came along and ate the bowstrings of Sennacherib’s army, he thought that a cautious and sensible mind would be on the side of the angels, because they knew that mice did not do such things—unless it was angels who induced them to do it, in which case he wished that one of the great artists had painted a picture of it. He thought that people disbelieved in miracles, first because, though they knew that God could do those things, they did not think that He would. They confused the laws of nature with the laws of thought, and they thought that the resurrection of the dead was something intrinsically impossible, like two and two making five. The answer was that there was an activity of God displayed through creation, and men refused to recognize it. Miracles were a performance, close-up, very quick, and very small, of what God in His wholesale activity was doing all the time. Of God’s wholesale activity, part was already unrolled; other parts were not yet done on a wholesale scale.<br><br><b>Our Lord’s Miracles</b><br><br>Some of our Lord’s miracles reminded men of what God had already done; others pointed to what He had not yet done wholesale. God had created water and the vine; and He used the vine to draw up water and form a juice which, when fermented, became wine. So every year God turned water into wine. But, of course, when Christ, God Incarnate, turned water into wine in a moment, then the thing was being done in small letters so that men could recognize it. The teaching of the miracle would have its full effect when they never passed a vine without thinking: “Here works He Who turned water into wine at the marriage feast in Cana.” Every Year God turned water into wine, and men did not see it. When Christ fed the five thousand, He multiplied bread that was there. He did not make bread out of nothing, or out of stones. It was the devil who suggested that Christ should command stones to become bread. In the feeding of the five thousand, Christ did the same kind of thing as God did in nature. A doctor knew that, if there was any magic in healing, it was not in the medicine, but in the patient’s body. The medicine could only remove obstructions, or stimulate activity. Every man who was healed was healed by God from within, and men did not see it. But once God did it with the mask off, quickly and suddenly, by our Lord’s miraculous action.<br><br><b>The Virgin Birth</b><br><br>Then they came to the one miracle which for some reason seemed a greater offence to the modern mind than any other. What were they to make of the person who said: “I can believe in some miracles, but not in the Virgin Birth?” Was it that it seemed to be a slur on sexual intercourse, which seemed to be the one thing venerated in a world which had ceased to venerate? Yet nothing went further to the root of the matter. The actual moment of begetting was only the final apex, which, if they knew enough, they would have to trace back to the origin of matter. But once God did it in an instant of time, chiefly, of course, for a special purpose, avoiding the silt carried down through the ages, because at that moment He was recreating the world, but also showing men where life came from. There could be only one source of life. There was only one life. He asked them not to suppose that what he was saying was an attempt to make miracles less miraculous. To do suddenly what God did in nature, those things were miracles. They were of a different kind from Grimm’s Fairy Tales and Ovid’s Metamorphoses, which were great fun to read, but the slightest suspicion of truth in them would be a nightmare. True miracles implied not merely a god, but God.<br><br>Secondly, there were the miracles which foretold what God had not yet done wholesale. He raised one man from the dead, because one day He would raise all men. The Resurrection in one sense involved a reversal of nature. It meant a process in the opposite direction to that man had seen. It did not, he thought, imply the return to personality of the same particles as those which had made the body. But it meant that they would see played forward a film which they had only seen played backward. Of course, they could not realize an event outside all their experience.<br><br>Athanasius and George Macdonald seemed to have been very right. Both the laws of nature and miracles were full stores for the questioning intellect. If miracles meant that which could not be explained, then nature herself was one great miracle.",

Yet I cannot do otherwise. To think of my own lecture is to think of those other lectures at Oxford in which you partly anticipated, partly confirmed, and most of all clarified and matured, what I had long been thinking about Milton. The scene was, in a way, medieval, and may prove to have been historic. You were a <i>vagus</i> thrown among us by the chance of war. The appropriate beauties of the Divinity School provided your background. There we elders heard (among other things) what we had long despaired of hearing—a lecture on <i>Comus</i> which placed its importance where the poet placed it—and watched “the yonge fresshe folkes, he or she,” who filled the benches listening first with incredulity, then with toleration, and finally with delight, to something so strange and new in their experience as the praise of chastity. Reviewers, who have not had time to re-read Milton, have failed for the most part to digest your criticism of him; but it is a reasonable hope that of those who heard you in Oxford many will understand henceforward that when the old poets made some virtue their theme they were not teaching but adoring, and that what we take for the didactic is often the enchanted. It gives me a sense of security to remember that, far from loving your work because you are my friend, I first sought your friendship because I loved your books. But for that, I should find it difficult to believe that your short <i>Preface</i> (<i>The Poetical Works of Milton</i>. The World’s Classics, 1940) to Milton is what it seems to me to be—the recovery of a true critical tradition after more than a hundred years of laborious misunderstanding. The ease with which the thing was done would have seemed inconsistent with the weight that had to be lifted. As things are, I feel entitled to trust my own eyes. Apparently the door of the prison was really unlocked all the time; but it was only you who thought of trying the handle. Now we can all come out.<br><br>Yours,<br>C.S. Lewis",

        textProvided: "[p.5] PREFACE TO THIRD EDITION<br><br>On re-reading this book ten years after I wrote it, I find its chief faults to be those two which I myself least easily forgive in the books of other men: needless obscurity, and an uncharitable temper.<br><br>There were two causes, I now realise, for the obscurity. On the intellectual side my own progress had been from ‘popular realism’ to Philosophical Idealism; from Idealism to Pantheism; from Pantheism to Theism; and from Theism to Christianity. I still think this a very natural road, but I now know that it is a road very rarely trodden. In the early thirties I did not know this. If I had had any notion of my own isolation, I should either have kept silent about my journey or else endeavoured to describe it with more consideration for the reader’s difficulties. As things were, I committed the same sort of blunder as one who should narrate his travels through the Gobi Desert on the assumption that this route was as familiar to the British public as the line from Euston to Crewe. And this original blunder was soon aggravated by a profound change in the philosophical thought of our age. Idealism itself went out of fashion. The dynasty of Green, Bradley, and Bosanquet fell, and the world inhabited by philosophical students of my own generation became as alien to our successors as if not years but centuries had intervened.<br><br>The second cause of obscurity was the (unintentionally) ‘private’ meaning I then gave to the word ‘Romanticism’. I would not now use this word to describe the experience which is central in this book. I would not, indeed, use it to describe anything, for I now believe it to be a word of such varying senses that it has become useless and should be banished from our vocabulary. Even if we exclude the vulgar sense in which a ‘romance’ means simply ‘a love affair’ (Peer and Film Star Romance) I think we can distinguish at least seven kinds of things which are called ‘romantic’.<br><br>1. Stories about dangerous adventure—particularly, dangerous adventure in the past or in remote places—are ‘romantic’. In this sense Dumas is a typically ‘romantic’ author, and stories about sailing [6] ships, the Foreign Legion, and the rebellion of 1745, are usually ‘romantic’.<br><br>2. The marvellous is ‘romantic’, provided it does not make part of the believed religion. Thus magicians, ghosts, fairies, witches, dragons, nymphs, and dwarfs are ‘romantic’; angels, less so. Greek gods are ‘romantic’ in Mr James Stephens or Mr Maurice Hewlett; not so in Homer and Sophocles. In this sense Malory, Boiardo, Ariosto, Spenser, Tasso, Mrs Radcliffe, Shelley, Coleridge, William Morris, and Mr E.R. Eddison are ‘romantic’ authors.<br><br>3. The art dealing with ‘Titanic’ characters, emotions strained beyond the common pitch, and high-flown sentiments or codes of honour is ‘romantic’. (I welcome the growing use of the word ‘Romanesque’ to describe this type.) In this sense Rostand and Sidney are ‘romantic’, and so (though unsuccessfully) are Dryden’s Heroic Dramas, and there is a good deal of ‘romanticism’ in Corneille. I take it that Michelangelo is, in this sense, a ‘romantic’ artist.<br><br>4. ‘Romanticism’ can also mean the indulgence in abnormal, and finally in anti-natural, moods. The <i>macabre is</i> ‘romantic’, and so is an interest in torture, and a love of death. This, if I understand them, is what M. Mario Praz and M.D. de Rougemont would mean by the word. In this sense <i>Tristan</i> is Wagner’s most ‘romantic’ opera; Poe, Baudelaire, and Flaubert, are ‘romantic’ authors; Surrealism is ‘romantic’.<br><br>5. Egoism and Subjectivism are ‘romantic’. In this sense the typically ‘romantic’ books are <i>Werther</i> and Rousseau’s <i>Confessions</i>, and the works of Byron and Proust.<br><br>6. Every revolt against existing civilisation and conventions whether it look forward to revolution, or backward to the ‘primitive’ is called ‘romantic’ by some people. Thus pseudo-Ossian, Epstein, D.H. Lawrence, Walt Whitman, and Wagner are ‘romantic’.<br><br>7. Sensibility to natural objects, when solemn and enthusiastic, is ‘romantic’. In this sense <i>The Prelude</i> is the most ‘romantic’ poem in the world: and there is much ‘romanticism’ in Keats, Shelley, de Vigny, de Musset, and Goethe.<br><br>It will be seen, of course, that many writers are ‘romantic’ on more than one account. Thus Morris comes in my first class as well [7] as my second, Mr Eddison in my second as well as my third, Rousseau in my sixth as well as my fifth, Shelley in my sixth and fifth, and so on. This may suggest some common root, whether historical or psychological, for all seven: but the real qualitative difference between them is shown by the fact that a liking for any one does not imply liking for the others. Though people who are ‘romantic’ in different senses may turn to the same books, they turn to them for different reasons and one half of William Morris’s readers do not know how the other half live. It makes all the difference in the world whether you like Shelley because he provides a mythology or because he promises a revolution. Thus I myself always loved the second kind of Romanticism and detested the fourth and fifth kinds; I liked the first very little and the third only after I was grown-up—as an acquired taste.<br><br>But what I meant by ‘Romanticism’ when I wrote <i>The Pilgrim’s Regress</i>—and what I would still be taken to mean on the title page of this book—was not exactly any one of these seven things. What I meant was a particular recurrent experience which dominated my childhood and adolescence and which I hastily called ‘Romantic’ because inanimate nature and marvellous literature were among the things that evoked it. I still believe that the experience is common, commonly misunderstood, and of immense importance: but I know now that in other minds it arises under other <i>stimuli</i> and is entangled with other irrelevancies and that to bring it into the forefront of consciousness is not so easy as I once supposed. I will now try to describe it sufficiently to make the following pages intelligible.<br><br>The experience is one of intense longing. It is distinguished from other longings by two things. In the first place, though the sense of want is acute and even painful, yet the mere wanting is felt to be somehow a delight. Other desires are felt as pleasures only if satisfaction is expected in the near future: hunger is pleasant only while we know (or believe) that we are soon going to eat. But this desire, even when there is no hope of possible satisfaction, continues to be prized, and even to be preferred to anything else in the world, by those who have once felt it. This hunger is better than any other fullness; this poverty better than all other wealth. And thus it comes about, that if the desire is long absent, it may itself be desired, and that new desiring becomes a new [8] instance of the original desire, though the subject may not at once recognise the fact and thus cries out for his lost youth of soul at the very moment in which he is being rejuvenated. This sounds complicated, but it is simple when we live it. ‘Oh to feel as I did then!’ we cry; not noticing that even while we say the words the very feeling whose loss we lament is rising again in all its old bitter-sweetness. For this sweet Desire cuts across our ordinary distinctions between wanting and having. To have it is, by definition, a want: to want it, we find, is to have it.<br><br>In the second place, there is a peculiar mystery about the <i>object</i> of this Desire. Inexperienced people (and inattention leaves some inexperienced all their lives) suppose, when they feel it, that they know what they are desiring. Thus if it comes to a child while he is looking at a far off hillside he at once thinks ‘if only I were there’; if it comes when he is remembering some event in the past, he thinks ‘if only I could go back to those days’. If it comes (a little later) while he is reading a ‘romantic’ tale or poem of ‘perilous seas and faerie lands forlorn’, he thinks he is wishing that such places really existed and that he could reach them. If it comes (later still) in a context with erotic suggestions he believes he is desiring the perfect beloved. If he falls upon literature (like Maeterlinck or the early Yeats) which treats of spirits and the like with some show of serious belief, he may think that he is hankering for real magic and occultism. When it darts out upon him from his studies in history or science, he may confuse it with the intellectual craving for knowledge.<br><br>But every one of these impressions is wrong. The sole merit I claim for this book is that it is written by one who has proved them all to be wrong. There is no room for vanity in the claim: I know them to be wrong not by intelligence but by experience, such experience as would not have come my way if my youth had been wiser, more virtuous, and less self-centred than it was. For I have myself been deluded by every one of these false answers in turn, and have contemplated each of them earnestly enough to discover the cheat. To have embraced so many false Florimels is no matter for boasting: it is fools, they say, who learn by experience. But since they do at last learn, let a fool bring his experience into the common stock that wiser men may profit by it.<br><br>[9] Every one of these supposed <i>objects</i> for the Desire is inadequate to it. An easy experiment will show that by going to the far hillside you will get either nothing, or else a recurrence of the same desire which sent you thither. A rather more difficult, but still possible, study of your own memories, will prove that by returning to the past you could not find, as a possession, that ecstasy which some sudden reminder of the past now moves you to desire. Those remembered moments were either quite commonplace at the time (and owe all their enchantment to memory) or else were themselves moments of desiring. The same is true of the things described in the poets and marvellous romancers. The moment we endeavour to think out seriously what it would be like if they were actual, we discover this. When Sir Arthur Conan Doyle claimed to have photographed a fairy, I did not, in fact, believe it: but the mere making of the claim—the approach of the fairy to within even that hailing distance of actuality—revealed to me at once that if the claim had succeeded it would have chilled rather than satisfied the desire which fairy literature had hitherto aroused. Once grant your fairy, your enchanted forest, your satyr, faun, wood-nymph and well of immortality <i>real,</i> and amidst all the scientific, social and practical interest which the discovery would awake, the Sweet Desire would have disappeared, would have shifted its ground, like the cuckoo’s voice or the rainbow’s end, and be now calling us from beyond a <i>further</i> hill. With Magic in the darker sense (as it has been and is actually practised) we should fare even worse. How if one had gone that way—had actually called for something and it had come? What would one feel? Terror, pride, guilt, tingling excitement... but what would all that have to do with our Sweet Desire? It is not at Black Mass or <i>séance</i> that the Blue Flower grows. As for the sexual answer, that I suppose to be the most obviously false Florimel of all. On whatever plane you take it, it is not what we were looking for. Lust can be gratified. Another personality can become to us ‘our America, our New-found-land’. A happy marriage can be achieved. But what has any of the three, or any mixture of the three, to do with that unnameable something, desire for which pierces us like a rapier at the smell of a bonfire, the sound of wild ducks flying overhead, the title of <i>The Well at the World’s End,</i> the opening lines of <i>Kubla</i> [10] <i>Khan,</i> the morning cobwebs in late summer, or the noise of falling waves?<br><br>It appeared to me therefore that if a man diligently followed this desire, pursuing the false objects until their falsity appeared and then resolutely abandoning them, he must come out at last into the clear knowledge that the human soul was made to enjoy some object that is never fully given—nay, cannot even be imagined as given—in our present mode of subjective and spatio-temporal experience. This Desire was, in the soul, as the Siege Perilous in Arthur’s castle—the chair in which only one could sit. And if nature makes nothing in vain, the One who can sit in this chair must exist. I knew only too well how easily the longing accepts false objects and through what dark ways the pursuit of them leads us: but I also saw that the Desire itself contains the corrective of all these errors. The only fatal error was to pretend that you had passed from desire to fruition, when, in reality, you had found either nothing, or desire itself, or the satisfaction of some different desire. The dialectic of Desire, faithfully followed, would retrieve all mistakes, head you off from all false paths, and force you not to propound, but to live through, a sort of ontological proof. This lived dialectic, and the merely argued dialectic of my philosophical progress, seemed to have converged on one goal; accordingly I tried to put them both into my allegory which thus became a defence of Romanticism (in my peculiar sense) as well as of Reason and Christianity.<br><br>After this explanation the reader will more easily understand (I do not ask him to condone) the bitterness of certain pages in this book. He will realise how the Post-War period must have looked to one who had followed such a road as mine. The different intellectual movements of that time were hostile to one another; but the one thing that seemed to unite them all was their common enmity to ‘immortal longings’. The direct attack carried out on them from below by those who followed Freud or D.H. Lawrence, I think I could have borne with some temper; what put me out of patience was the scorn which claimed to be from above, and which was voiced by the American ‘Humanists’, the Neo-Scholastics, and some who wrote for <i>The Criterion</i>. These people seemed to me to be condemning what they did not understand. When they called Romanticism ‘nostalgia’ I, who [11] had rejected long ago the illusion that the desired object was in the past, felt that they had not even crossed the <i>Pons Asinorum.</i> In the end I lost my temper.<br><br>If I were now writing a book I could bring the question between those thinkers and myself to a much finer point. One of them described Romanticism as ‘spilled religion’. I accept the description. And I agree that he who has religion ought not to spill it. But does it follow that he who finds it spilled should avert his eyes? How if there is a man to whom those bright drops on the floor are the beginning of a trail which, duly followed, will lead him in the end to taste the cup itself? How if no other trail, humanly speaking, were possible? Seen in this light my ten years’ old quarrel both with the counter-Romantics on the one hand and with the sub-Romantics on the other (the apostles of instinct and even of gibberish) assumes, I trust, a certain permanent interest. Out of this double quarrel came the dominant image of my allegory—the barren, aching rocks of its ‘North’, the foetid swamps of its ‘South’, and between them the Road on which alone mankind can safely walk.<br><br>The things I have symbolised by North and South, which are to me equal and opposite evils, each continually strengthened and made plausible by its critique of the other, enter our experience on many different levels. In agriculture we have to fear both the barren soil and the soil which is irresistibly fertile. In the animal kingdom, the crustacean and the jellyfish represent two low solutions of the problem of existence. In our eating, the palate revolts both from excessive bitter and excessive sweet. In art, we find on the one hand, purists and doctrinaires, who would rather (like Scaliger) lose a hundred beauties than admit a single fault, and who cannot believe anything to be good if the unlearned spontaneously enjoy it: on the other hand, we find the uncritical and slovenly artists who will spoil the whole work rather than deny themselves any indulgence of sentiment or humour or sensationalism. Everyone can pick out among his own acquaintance the Northern and Southern types—the high noses, compressed lips, pale complexions, dryness and taciturnity of the one, the open mouths, the facile laughter and tears, the garrulity and (so to speak) general greasiness of the others. The Northerners are the men of rigid systems [12] whether sceptical or dogmatic, Aristocrats, Stoics, Pharisees, Rigorists, signed and sealed members of highly organised ‘Parties’. The Southerners are by their very nature less definable; boneless souls whose doors stand open day and night to almost every visitant, but always with readiest welcome for those, whether Maenad or Mystagogue, who offer some sort of intoxication. The delicious tang of the forbidden and the unknown draws them on with fatal attraction; the smudging of all frontiers, the relaxation of all resistances, dream, opium, darkness, death, and the return to the womb. Every feeling is justified by the mere fact that it is felt: for a Northerner, every feeling on the same ground is suspect. An arrogant and hasty selectiveness on some narrow <i>a priori</i> basis cuts him off from the sources of life. In Theology also there is a North and South. The one cries ‘Drive out the bondmaid’s son,’ and the other ‘Quench not the smoking flax’. The one exaggerates the distinctness between Grace and Nature into a sheer opposition and by vilifying the higher levels of Nature (the real <i>praeparatio evangelica</i> inherent in certain immediately sub-Christian experiences) makes the way hard for those who are at the point of coming in. The other blurs the distinction altogether, flatters mere kindliness into thinking it is charity and vague optimisms or pantheisms into thinking that they are Faith, and makes the way out fatally easy and imperceptible for the budding apostate. The two extremes do not coincide with Romanism (to the North) and Protestantism (to the South). Barth might well have been placed among my Pale Men, and Erasmus might have found himself at home with Mr Broad.<br><br>I take our own age to be predominantly Northern—it is two great ‘Northern’ powers that are tearing each other to pieces on the Don while I write. But the matter is complicated, for the rigid and ruthless system of the Nazis has ‘Southern’ and swamplike elements at its centre; and when our age is ‘Southern’ at all, it is excessively so. D.H. Lawrence and the Surrealists have perhaps reached a point further ‘South’ than humanity ever reached before. And this is what one would expect. Opposite evils, far from balancing, aggravate each other. ‘The heresies that men leave are hated most’; widespread drunkenness is the father of Prohibition and Prohibition of widespread drunkenness. Nature outraged by one extreme, avenges herself by flying to the [13] other. One can even meet adult males who are not ashamed to attribute their philosophy to ‘Reaction’ and do not think the philosophy thereby discredited. <br><br>With both the ‘North’ and the ‘South’ a man has, I take it, only one concern—to avoid them and hold the Main Road. We must not ‘hearken to the over-wise or to the over-foolish giant.’ We were made to be neither cerebral men nor visceral men, but Men. Not beasts nor angels but Men—things at once rational and animal.<br><br>The fact that, if I say anything in explanation of my North and South, I have to say so much, serves to underline a rather important truth about symbols. In the present edition I have tried to make the book easier by a running headline. But I do so with great reluctance. To supply a ‘key’ to an allegory may encourage that particular misunderstanding of allegory which, as a literary critic, I have elsewhere denounced. It may encourage people to suppose that allegory is a disguise, a way of saying obscurely what could have been said more clearly. But in fact all good allegory exists not to hide but to reveal; to make the inner world more palpable by giving it an (imagined) concrete embodiment. My headline is there only because my allegory failed—partly through my own fault (I am now heartily ashamed of the preposterous allegorical filigree on p. 98), and partly because modern readers are unfamiliar with the method. But it remains true that wherever the symbols are best, the key is least adequate. For when allegory is at its best, it approaches myth, which must be grasped with the imagination, not with the intellect. If, as I still sometimes hope, my North and South and my Mr Sensible have some touch of mythical life, then no amount of ‘explanation’ will quite catch up with their meaning. It is the sort of thing you cannot learn from definition, you must rather get to know it as you get to know smell or a taste, the ‘atmosphere’ of a family or a country town, or the personality of an individual.<br><br>Three other cautions remain to be given. 1. The map on the end leaves has puzzled some readers because, as they say, ‘it marks all sorts of places not mentioned in the text’. But so do all maps in travel books. John’s route is marked with a dotted line: those who are not interested in the places off that route need not bother about them. They are a half [14] whimsical attempt to fill in the ‘Northern’ and ‘Southern’ halves of the world with the spiritual phenomena appropriate to them. Most of the names explain themselves. <i>Wanhope</i> is Middle English for Despair; <i>Woodey</i> and <i>Lyssanesos</i> mean ‘Isle of Insanity’; <i>Behmenheim</i> is named, unfairly, after Jakob Boehme or Behmen; <i>Golnesshire</i> (Anglo-Saxon Gál) is the county of Lechery; in <i>Trine</i>-land one feels ‘in tune with the infinite’; and <i>Zeitgeistheim,</i> of course, is the habitat of the <i>Zeitgeist</i> or Spirit of the Age. Naughtstow is ‘a place that is no good at all’. The two military railways were meant to symbolise the double attack from Hell on the two sides of our nature. It was hoped that the roads spreading out from each of the enemy railheads would look rather like claws or tentacles reaching out into the country of Man’s Soul. If you like to put little black arrows pointing South on the seven Northern roads (in the fashion of the newspaper war maps) and others pointing North on the six Southern roads, you would get a clear picture of the Holy War as I see it. You might amuse yourself by deciding where to put them—a question that admits different answers. On the Northern front, for example, I should represent the enemy in occupation of Cruelsland and Superbia, and thus threatening the Pale Men with a pincer movement. But I don’t claim to know; and doubtless the position shifts every day. 2. The name <i>Mother Kirk</i> was chosen because ‘Christianity’ is not a very convincing name. Its defect was that it not unnaturally led the reader to attribute to me a much more definite <i>Ecclesiastical</i> position than I could really boast of. The book is concerned solely with Christianity as against unbelief. ‘Denominational’ questions do not come in. 3. In this preface the autobiographical element in John has had to be stressed because the source of the obscurities lay there. But you must not assume that everything in the book is autobiographical. I was attempting to generalise, not to tell people about my own life.<br><br>C.S. LEWIS",

The first step towards being grown up is to realize that this is balderdash.<br><br>Christianity isn’t a hobby, or even a patent medicine. It makes statements: God exists—man is broken—God became a man—that man can mend all other men—no one else can—those who are not mended go into the dustbin. If these statements are true, they concern everyone, and are of infinite importance. If they’re not, they concern nobody and are of no importance. Either zero—or infinity.

He became a man to mend you (how would you like to become a cow for several years?). He keeps you alive from moment to moment. He gives you every minute of the time you call your own. You are, in fact, His property and He wants you. There are enemies about—His enemies and yours—who also want you. If you don’t belong to Him, you’ll belong to them. The war between them and Him is too hot for neutrals. If you try to be a neutral you’ll be invaded by the enemies.

That is why we ask you to put yourself wholly (every bit of you counts) and at once (every minute matters) on His side. Report for duty. Say your first prayer, wherever you happen to be, at once.

The principal facts of my life are not (in a form suitable for biography) known to me. I was a younger son, and we lost my mother when I was a child. That meant very long days alone when my father was at work and my brother at boarding school. Alone in a big house full of books. I suppose that fixed a literary bent. I drew a lot, but soon began to write more. My first stories were mostly about mice (influence of Beatrix Potter), but mice usually in armor killing gigantic cats (influence of fairy stories). That is, I wrote the books I should have liked to read if only I could have got them. That’s always been my reason for writing. People won’t write the books I want, so I have to do it for myself: no rot about “self-expression.” I loathed school. Being an infantry soldier in the last war would have been nicer if one had known one was going to survive. I was wounded—by an English shell. (Hence the greetings of an aunt who said, with obvious relief, “Oh, so that’s why you were wounded in the back!”) I gave up Christianity at about fourteen. Came back to it when getting on for thirty. An almost purely philosophical conversion. I didn’t want to. I’m not the religious type. I want to be let alone, to feel I’m my own master: but since the facts seemed to be the opposite I had to give in.

        textProvided: "One might argue, Mr Lewis continued, that reason had developed by natural selection, only those methods of thought which had proved useful surviving. But the theory depends on an inference from usefulness to truth, of which the validity would have to be assumed. All attempts to treat thought as a natural event involve the fallacy of excluding the thought of the man making the attempt.<br><br>It is admitted that the mind is affected by physical events; a wireless set is influenced by atmospherics, but it does not originate its deliverances — we’d take no notice of it if we thought it did. Natural events we can relate one to another until we can trace them finally to the space-time continuum. But thought has no father but thought. It is conditioned, yes, not caused. My knowledge that I have nerves is inferential.<br><br>The same argument applies to our values, which are affected by social factors, but if they are caused by them we cannot know that they are right. One can reject morality as an illusion, but the man who does so often tacitly excepts his own ethical motive: for instance the duty of freeing morality from superstition and of spreading enlightenment.<br><br>Neither Will nor Reason is the product of Nature. Therefore either I am self-existent (a belief which no one can accept) or I am a colony of some Thought and Will that are self-existent. Such reason and goodness as we can attain must be derived from a self-existent Reason and Goodness outside ourselves, in fact, a Supernatural.<br><br>Mr Lewis went on to say that it was often objected that the existence of the Supernatural is too important to be discernible only by abstract argument, and thus only by the leisured few. But in all other ages the plain man has accepted the findings of the mystics and the philosophers for his initial belief in the existence of the Supernatural. Today the ordinary man is forced to carry that burden himself. Either mankind has made a ghastly mistake in rejecting authority, or the power or powers ruling his destiny are making a daring experiment, and all are to become sages. A society consisting solely of plain men must end in disaster. If we are to survive we must either believe the seers or scale those heights ourselves.<br><br>Evidently, then, something beyond Nature exists. Man is on the border line between the Natural and the Supernatural. Material events cannot produce spiritual activity, but the latter can be responsible for many of our actions on Nature. Will and Reason cannot depend on anything but themselves, but Nature can depend on Will and Reason, or, in other words, God created Nature.<br><br>The relation between Nature and Supernature, which is not a relation in space and time, becomes intelligible if the Supernatural made the Natural. We even have an idea of this making, since we know the power of imagination, though we can create nothing new, but can only rearrange our material provided through sense-data. It is not inconceivable that the universe was created by an Imagination strong enough to impose phenomena on other minds.<br><br>It had been suggested, Mr Lewis concluded, that our ideas of making and causing are wholly derived from our experience of will. The conclusion usually drawn is that there is no making or causing, only “projection”. But “projection” is itself a form of causing, and it is more reasonable to suppose that Will is the only cause we know, and that therefore Will is the cause of Nature.<br><br>A Discussion followed. Points arising:<br><br>All reasoning assumes the hypothesis that inference is valid. Correct inference is self-evident.<br><br>“Relevant” (re evidence) is a rational term.<br><br>The universe doesn’t claim to be true: it’s just there.<br><br>Knowledge by revelation is more like empirical than rational knowledge.<br><br>Question: What is the criterion of truth, if you distinguish between cause and reason?<br><br>Mr Lewis: A mountainous country might have several maps made of it, only one of which was a true one, i.e., corresponding with the actual contours. The map drawn by Reason claims to be that true one. I couldn’t get at the universe unless I could trust my reason. If we couldn’t trust inference we could know nothing but our own existence. Physical reality is an inference from sensations.<br><br>Question: How can an axiom claim self-evidence any more than an empirical judgment on evidence?",

I have tried to explain in previous talks why I think Christianity true. Here I am not trying to prove anything; only to describe what the Christian belief is. It is hoped that this may be of some use both to those who accept Christianity and to those who don’t: indeed it is not much good discussing whether certain beliefs are true before we know what they are. Some listeners were offended because I used the words ‘Christian belief’ to describe the doctrines officially held by organised Christianity at nearly all times and in nearly all countries. They themselves, though claiming to be Christians, differed from this official belief on certain points, and they were annoyed because I seemed to be saying that they were therefore no Christians: and ‘Who’s he’, they asked, ‘to lay down who is a Christian and who is not?’ In reality I was not attempting (in the sense they mean) to lay down anything of the sort. If anyone was asked to give an account, say, of Mohammedanism in seven very short talks he would be forced to concentrate on the general central Mohammedan tradition. He simply wouldn’t have time to go into minor variations, still less to deal with the beliefs of individual Mohammedans. In his talks the word ‘Mohammedanism’ would simply <i>have</i> to be used to mean that permanent central tradition. I dealt with Christianity in the same way. I should have had to do so even if I personally did not regard the central tradition as being Chrsitianity at its truest. In point of fact I do regard it as true, and consequently I must think that those who depart from it are mistaken. Some people say this attitude is ‘intolerant’. ‘He’s the sort of man’, they complain, ‘who thinks his own [6] beliefs are true and everyone else’s are wrong.’ But after all how can any man help doing that? A man must think his own belief true because if he didn’t it would not be his belief. ‘Your belief’ <i>means</i> ‘what you think true’. And if you think one thing true, of course you must think the opposite false. But this is a very different thing from saying that those who hold the opposite belief are necessarily bad or stupid. There is a deeper sense of the word ‘Christian’ in which some who hold wrong beliefs may be more Christian than some who hold the right ones. Christ, who can see into their hearts, may recognise them as His own, and more His own than many of the orthodox. Needless to say, I never dreamed of laying down who was a ‘Christian’ in that sense. It would have been the grossest impudence for me even to raise the question, for neither I nor any mortal can possibly know the answer.<br><br>April 15th, 1944<br>C.S. Lewis",

It was work that exactly suited him—to seem to be doing nothing and yet actually to guide the whole debate. He said surprisingly little: it was only afterwards one realized how his <i>exiguum clinamen</i> had, at several points, headed us all off from some blind alley, or how a few unemphatic words of apparent agreement had turned a half truth into a whole one and tacitly suppressed an error. It never crossed our minds that the papers we read and the arguments we had about them could be less interesting, novel and momentous to him than they were to us. This was partly, no doubt, because he had a real sympathy with youth: still more, as I now realize, because he was doing his job so well that we never saw it was a “job” at all.

        textProvided: "When I was asked to write a Christmas sermon for Pagans I accepted the job light-heartedly enough: but now that I sit down to tackle it I discover a difficulty. Are there any Pagans in England for me to write to?<br><br>I know that people keep on telling us that this country is relapsing into Paganism. But they only mean it is ceasing to be Christian. And is that at all the same thing? Let us remember what a Pagan or Heathen (I use the words interchangeably) really was. <br><br>A “Heathen” meant a man who lived out on the heath, out in the wilds. A “Pagan” meant a man who lived in a <i>Pagus</i> or small village. Both words, in fact, meant a “rustic” or “yokel”. They date from the time when the larger towns of the Roman Empire were already Christianised, but the old Nature religions still lingered in the country. Pagans or Heathens were the backward people in the remote districts who had not yet been converted, who were still pre-Christian.<br><br>To say that modern people who have drifted away from Christianity are Pagans is to suggest that a post-Christian man is the same as a pre-Christian man. And that is like thinking that a woman who has lost her husband is the same sort of person as an unmarried girl: or that a street where the houses have been knocked down is the same as a field where no house has yet been built. The ruined street and the unbuilt field are alike in one respect: namely that neither will keep you dry if it rains. But they are different in every other respect. Rubble, dust, broken bottles, old bedsteads and stray cats are very different from [31] grass, thyme, clover, buttercups and a lark singing overhead.<br><br>Now the real Pagan differed from the post-Christian in the following ways. Firstly, he was religious. From the Christian point of view he was indeed too religious by half. He was full of reverence. To him the earth was holy, the woods and waters were alive. His agriculture was a ritual as well as a technique. And secondly, he believed in what we now call an “Objective” Right or Wrong. That is he thought the distinction between pious and impious acts was something which existed independently of human opinions: something like the multiplication table which Man had not invented but had found to be true and which (like the multiplication table) he had better take notice of. The gods would punish him if he did not.<br><br>To be sure, by Christian standards, his list of “Right” or “Wrong” acts was rather a muddled one. He thought (and the Christians agreed) that the gods would punish him for setting the dogs on a beggar who came to his door or for striking his father: but he also thought they would punish him for turning his face to the wrong point of the compass when he began ploughing. But though his code included some fantastic sins and duties, it got in most of the real ones. And this leads us to the third great difference between a Pagan and a post-Christian man. Believing in a real Right and Wrong means finding out that you are not very good. The Pagan code may have been on some points a low one: but it was too high for the Pagan to live up to. Hence a Pagan, though in many ways merrier than a modern, had a deep sadness. When he asked himself what was wrong with the world he did not immediately reply, “the social system,” or “our allies,” or “education.” It occurred to him that he himself might be one of the things that was wrong with the world. He knew he had sinned. And the terrible thing was that he thought the gods made no difference between voluntary and involuntary sins. You might get into their bad books by mere accident, and once in, it was very hard to get out of them. And the Pagan dealt with this situation in a rather silly way. His religion was a mass of ceremonies (sacrifices, purifications, etc.) which were supposed to take away guilt. But they never quite [32] succeeded. His conscience was not at ease. <br><br>Now the post-Christian view which is gradually coming into existence—it is complete already in some people and still incomplete in others—is quite different. According to it Nature is not a live thing to be reverenced: it is a kind of machine for us to exploit. There is no objective Right or Wrong: each race or class can invent its own code or “ideology” just as it pleases. And whatever may be amiss with the world, it is certainly not we, not the ordinary people; it is up to God (if, after all, He should happen to exist), or to Government, or to Education, to give us what we want. They are the shop, we are the customers: and “the customer is always right”.<br><br>Now if the post-Christian view is the correct one, then we have indeed waked from a nightmare. The old fear, the old reverence, the old restraints—how delightful to have waked up into freedom, to be responsible to no one, to be utterly and absolutely our own masters! We have, of course, lost some <i>fun</i>. A universe of colourless electrons (which is presently going to run down and annihilate all organic life everywhere and forever) is, perhaps, a little dreary compared with the earth-mother and the sky-father, the wood nymphs and the water nymphs, chaste Diana riding the night sky and homely Vesta flickering on the hearth. But one can’t have everything, and there are always the flicks and the radio: if the new view is correct, it has very solid advantages.<br><br>But is it? And if so, why are things not going better? What do you make of the present threat of world famine? We know now that it is not entirely due to the war. From country after country comes the same story of failing harvests: even the whales have less oil. Can it be that Nature (or something behind Nature) is not simply a machine that we can do what we like with?—that she is hitting back?<br><br>Waive that point. Suppose she is only a machine and that we are free to master her at our pleasure. Have you not begun to see that Man’s conquest of Nature is really Man’s conquest of Man? That every power wrested from Nature is used by some men over other men? Men are the victims, not the conquerors in the struggle: each new victory “over Nature” yields new means of propaganda to enslave them, new weapons to kill them, new power for the State and new weakness for the citizen, new contraceptives to keep men from being born at all.<br><br>As for the ideologies, the new invented Wrongs and Rights, does no one see the catch? If there is no <i>real</i> Wrong and Right, nothing good or bad in itself, none of these ideologies can be better or worse than another. For a better moral code can only mean one which comes nearer to some real or absolute code. One map of New York can be better than another only if there is a real New York for it to be truer <i>to</i>. If there is no objective standard, then our choice between one ideology and another becomes a matter of arbitrary taste. Our battle for democratic ideals [33] against Nazi ideals has been a waste of time, because the one is no better than the other. Nor can there ever be any real improvement or deterioration: if there is no real goal you can’t get either nearer to it or farther from it. In fact, there is no real reason for doing anything at all.<br><br>It looks to me, neighbours, as though we shall have to set about becoming true Pagans if only as a preliminary to becoming Christians. I don’t mean that we should begin leaving little bits of bread under the tree at the end of the garden as an offering to the Dryad. I don’t mean that we should dance to Dionysus across Hampstead Heath (though perhaps a little more solemn or ecstatic gaiety and a little less commercialised “amusements” might make our holidays better than they now are). I don’t even mean (though I very much wish) that we should recover that sympathy with nature, that religious attitude to the family and that appetite for beauty which the better Pagans had. Perhaps what I do mean is best put like this.<br><br>If the modern post-Christian view is wrong—and every day I find it harder to think it is right—then there are three kinds of people in the world. (1) Those who are sick and don’t know it (the post-Christian). (2) Those who are sick and know it (Pagans). (3) Those who have found the cure. And if you start in the first class you must go through the second to reach the third. For (in a sense) all that Christianity adds to Paganism is the cure. It confirms the old belief that in this universe we are up against Living Power: that there is a real Right and that we have failed to obey it: that existence is beautiful and terrifying. It adds a wonder of which Paganism had not distinctly heard—that the Mighty One has come down to help us, to remove our guilt, to reconcile us. <br><br>All over the world (even in Japan, even in Russia) men and women will meet on December 25th to do what is a very old-fashioned and, if you like, a very Pagan thing—to sing and feast because a God has been born. You are uncertain whether it is more than a myth. Well, if it is, then our last hope is gone. But is the opposite explanation not worth trying?<br><br>Who knows but that here, and here alone, lies your way back not only to Heaven, but to Earth too, and to the great human family whose oldest hopes are confirmed by this story that does not die?",

Qui est, se demande-t-on, ce laïc anglican, traduit et présenté par des catholiques, et qui unit sur la page de garde des Screwtape Letters une citation de Sir Thomas More à un texte de Martin Luther? Ignore-t-il les différences entre chrétiens ou les estime-t-il sans importance? En aucune façon. Comme chrétien, je suis très conscient que nos divisions attristent le Saint-Esprit et retardent l’œuvre du Christ; comme logicien, je reconnais que là où deux Eglises énoncent des affirmations qui s’opposent, ces affirmations ne peuvent être conciliées. Mais comme je fus longtemps incroyant, je me suis rendu compte d’une chose que peut-être les fidèles de naissance ne voient pas. Quand je craignais et détestais le christianisme, la grande unité, qu’en dépit de ses divisions il ne cessait de détenir, me frappa. Je reconnus, et je tremblai à cette reconnaissance, le même arôme irrécusable, qui me parvenait à travers l’œuvre de Dante ou celle de Bunyan, celle de Thomas d’Aquin ou de William Law. Depuis ma conversion, il m’a semblé que c’était ma tâche particulière d’apprendre au monde extérieur ce que croient tous les chrétiens. Je laisse à d’autres les controverses; c’est une matière qui regarde les théologiens avertis. Je crois que vous et moi, le laïcat, les simples soldats de la foi, servirons mieux de manière habituelle la cause de la réconciliation, non en apportant notre contribution à de tels débats, mais par nos prières et par le partage en commun de tout ce qui peut être partagé de la vie chrétienne dès maintenant. Si l’unité de charité et d’intention était assez puissante entre nous, peut-être les dif-fé-rences doctrinales en seraient-elles plus tôt résolues; et sans cette unité spirituelle, un accord doctrinal entre nos chefs religieux serait stérile. Entre-temps, il apparaîtra que celui qui est le plus fidèle à vivre la vie chrétienne dans sa propre confession, est spirituellement le plus proche de ceux qui ne relèvent pas de la même obédience; car la géographie du monde spirituel est très différente de celle du monde physique. En ce dernier les pays se touchent par leurs frontières, dans le premier ils se touchent par leur centre. C’est le tiède et l’indifférent dans chaque région qui sont les plus éloignés de toute autre contrée.</p><p>[TRANSLATION 296-297]<br><br> I was asked to write a few words of introduction to this book for French readers, who might at first find something ambiguous in my position. Who, one might ask, is this Anglican layman, translated and introduced by Catholics, who, on the frontispiece of <i>The Screwtape Letters,</i> brings together a quotation from Sir Thomas More and one from Martin Luther? Is he unaware of the differences between Christians, or does he consider them unimportant? By no means. As a Christian, I am very much aware that our divisions grieve the Holy Spirit and hold back the work of Christ; as a logician I realize that when two churches affirm opposing positions, these cannot be reconciled. But because I was an unbeliever for a long time, I perceived something which perhaps those brought up in the Church do not see. Even when I feared and detested Christianity, I was struck by its essential unity, which, in spite of its divisions, it has never lost. I trembled on recognizing the same unmistakable aroma coming from the writings of Dante and Bunyan, Thomas Aquinas and William Law. Since my conversion, it has seemed my particular task to tell the outside world what all Christians believe. Controversy I leave to others: that is the business of theologians. I think that you and I, the laity, simple soldiers of the Faith, will best serve the cause of reconciliation not so much by contributing to such debates, but by our prayers, and by sharing all that can already be shared of Christian life. If the unity of charity and intention between us were strong enough, perhaps our doctrinal differences would be resolved sooner; without that spiritual unity, a doctrinal agreement between our religious leaders would be sterile. In the meantime, it will be apparent that the man who is most faithful in living the Christian life in his own church is spiritually the closest to the faithful believers in other confessions: because the geography of the spiritual world is very different from that of the physical world. In the latter, countries touch each other at their borders, in the former, at their centre. It is the lukewarm and indifferent in each country who are furthest from all other countries.</p> <p>[FRENCH 163 NOTE]<br><br> Actuellement, je considère la conception de l’Incarnation impliquée dans ce paragraphe, comme grossière et due à l’ignorance.</p> <p>[TRANSLATION 296]<br><br> I now consider the conception of the Incarnation implied in this paragraph as gross and the result of ignorance.</p>",

        textProvided: "At its original appearance in 1926, <i>Dymer,</i> like many better books, found some good reviews and almost no readers. The idea of disturbing its repose in the grave now comes from its publishers, not from me, but I have a reason for wishing to be present at the exhumation. Nearly a quarter of a century has gone since I wrote it, and in that time things have changed both within me and round me; my old poem might be misunderstood by those who now read it for the first time.<br><br>I am told that the Persian poets draw a distinction between poetry which they have ‘found’ and poetry which they have ‘brought’: if you like, between the given and the invented, though they wisely refuse to identify this with the distinction between good and bad. Their terminology applies with unusual clarity to my poem. What I ‘found’, what simply ‘came to me’, was the story of a man who, on some mysterious bride, begets a monster: which monster, as soon as it has killed its father, becomes a god. This story arrived, complete, in my mind somewhere about my seventeenth year. To the best of my knowledge I did not consciously or voluntarily invent it, nor was it, in the plain sense of that word, a dream. All I know about it is that there was a time when it was not there, and then presently a time when it was. Every one may allegorise it or psychoanalyse it as he pleases: and if I did so myself my interpretations would have no more authority than anyone else’s.<br><br>The Platonic and totalitarian state from which Dymer escapes in Canto I was a natural invention for one who detested the state in Plato’s <i>Republic</i> as much as he liked everything else in Plato, and who was, by temperament, an extreme anarchist. I put into it my hatred of my public school and my recent hatred of the army. But I was already critical of my own anarchism. There had been a time when the sense of defiant and almost drunken liberation which fills the first two acts of <i>Siegfried</i> had completely satisfied me. Now, I thought, I knew better. My hero therefore must go through his Siegfried moment in Cantos I and II and find in Canto IV what really comes of that mood in the end. For it seemed to me that two opposite forces in man tended equally to revolt. The one criticises and at need defies civilisation because it is not good enough, the other stabs it from below and behind because it is already too good for total baseness to endure. The hero who dethrones a tyrant will therefore be first feted and afterwards murdered by the rabble who feel a disinterested hatred of order and reason as such. Hence, in Canto IV, Bran’s revolt which at once parodies and punishes Dymer’s. It will be remembered that, when I wrote, the first horrors of the Russian Revolution were still fresh in every one’s mind; and in my own country, Ulster, we had had opportunities of observing the daemonic character of popular political ‘causes’.<br><br>In those days the new psychology was just beginning to make itself felt in the circles I most frequented at Oxford. This joined forces with the fact that we felt ourselves (as young men always do) to be escaping from the illusions of adolescence, and as a result we were much exercised about the problem of fantasy or wishful thinking. The ‘Christina Dream’; as we called it (after Christina Pontifex in Butler’s novel), was the hidden enemy whom we were all determined to unmask and defeat. My hero, therefore, had to be a man who had succumbed to its allurements and finally got the better of them. But the particular form in which this was worked out depended on two peculiarities of my own history.<br><br>(1) From at least the age of six, romantic longing—<i>Sehnsucht</i>—had played an unusually central part in my experience. Such longing is in itself the very reverse of wishful thinking: it is more like thoughtful wishing. But it throws off what may be called systems of imagery. One among many such which it had thrown off for me was the Hesperian or Western Garden system, mainly derived from Euripides, Milton, Morris, and the early Yeats. By the time I wrote <i>Dymer</i> I had come, under the influence of our common obsession about Christina Dreams, into a state of angry revolt against that spell. I regarded it as the very type of the illusions I was trying to escape from. It must therefore be savagely attacked. Dymer’s temptation to relapse into the world of fantasy therefore comes to him (Canto VII) in that form. All through that canto I am cutting down my own former ‘groves and high places’ and biting the hand that had fed me. I even tried to get the sneer into the metre; the archaic spelling and accentuation of <i>countrie</i> in vii. 23 is meant as parody. In all this, as I now believe, I was mistaken. Instead of repenting my idolatry I spat upon the images which only my own misunderstanding greed had ever made into idols. But ‘the heresies that men leave are hated most’ and lovers’ quarrels can be the bitterest of all.<br><br>(2) Several years before I wrote the poem, back in my teens, when my mind, except for a vigilant rejection of Christianity, had no fixed principles, and everything from strict materialism to theosophy could find by turns an entry, I had been, as boys are, temporarily attracted to what was then called ‘the Occult’. I blundered into it innocently enough. In those days every one was reading Maeterlinck, and I wanted to improve my French. Moreover, from Yeats’s early poetry it was natural to turn to his prose; and there I found to my astonishment that Yeats, unlike other romantic poets, really and literally believed in the sort of beings he put into his poems. There was no question here of ‘symbolism’: he believed in magic. And so for a time <i>Rosa Alchemica</i> took its turn (along with Voltaire, Lucretius, and Joseph McCabe) among my serious books. You will understand that this period had ended a long time (years are longer at that age) before I set about writing <i>Dymer</i>. By then, so far as I was anything, I was an idealist, and for an idealist all supernaturalisms were equally illusions, all ‘spirits’ merely symbols of ‘Spirit’ in the metaphysical sense, futile and dangerous if mistaken for facts. I put this into vii. 8. I was now quite sure that magic or spiritism of any kind was a fantasy and of all fantasies the worst. But this wholesome conviction had recently been inflamed into a violent antipathy. It had happened to me to see a man, and a man whom I loved, sink into screaming mania and finally into death under the influence, as I believed, of spiritualism. And I had also been twice admitted to the upper room in Yeats’s own house in Broad Street. His conversation turned much on magic. I was overawed by his personality, and by his doctrine half fascinated and half repelled because of the fascination.<br><br>The angel in the last canto does not of course mean that I had any Christian beliefs when I wrote the poem, any more (<i>si parva licet componere magnis</i>) than the conclusion of <i>Faust,</i> Part II, means that Goethe was a believer.<br><br>This, I think, explains all that the reader might want explained in my narrative. My hero was to be a man escaping from illusion. He begins by egregiously supposing the universe to be his friend and seems for a time to find confirmation of his belief. Then he tries, as we all try, to repeat his moment of youthful rapture. It cannot be done; the old Matriarch sees to that. On top of this rebuff comes the discovery of the consequences which his rebellion against the City has produced. He sinks into despair and gives utterance to the pessimism which had, on the whole, been my own view about six years earlier. Hunger and a shock of real danger bring him to his senses and he at last accepts reality. But just as he is setting out on the new and soberer life, the shabbiest of all brides is offered him; the false promise that by magic or invited illusion there may be a short cut back to the one happiness he remembers. He relapses and swallows the bait, but he has grown too mature to be really deceived. He finds that the wish-fulfilment dream leads to the fear-fulfilment dream, recovers himself, defies the Magician who tempted him, and faces his destiny.<br><br>The physical appearance of the Magician in vi. 6-9 owes something to Yeats as I saw him. If he were now alive I would ask his pardon with shame for having repaid his hospitality by such freedom. It was not done in malice, and the likeness is not, I think, in itself, uncomplimentary.<br><br>Since his great name here comes before us, let me take the opportunity of saluting his genius: a genius so potent that, having first revivified and transmuted that romantic tradition which he found almost on its deathbed (and invented a new kind of blank verse in the process), he could then go on to weather one of the bitterest literary revolutions we have known, embark on a second career, and, as it were with one hand, play most of the moderns off the field at their own game. If there is, as may be thought, a pride verging on insolence in his later work, such pride has never come so near to being excusable. It must have been difficult for him to respect either the mere Romantics who could only bewail a lost leader or the mere moderns who could see no difference between <i>On Baile’s Strand</i> and the work of Richard le Gallienne.<br><br>Some may be surprised at the strength of the anti-totalitarian feeling in a poem written so long ago. I had not read <i>Brave New World</i> or <i>Land Under England</i> or <i>The Aerodrome</i>: nor had we yet tasted the fruits of a planned economy in our own lives. This should be a warning for critics who attempt to date ancient texts too exactly on that kind of internal evidence.",

        textProvided: "Mr. C.S. Lewis, a junior colleague of Paul’s, has manifold memories of ‘Beneckiana.’ He writes:<br><br>‘Even when I first went to Magdalen (1925) Benecke was already an almost mythological figure and many of the stories told about him hardly pretended to be true. They mostly represented him in a ludicrous light. This might be misunderstood by one who did not know the habits of the English male. Our relations to him were like those of boys to a master who is always ridiculed behind his back, not although, but because, he is both loved and feared.<br><br>‘He was regarded by at least one of his junior colleagues (not me) as an inveterate romancer. I am sure myself that all his stories were intended to be strictly true, but possibly had unconsciously been moulded by a mixture of memory and imagination.<br><br>‘He said to me in serious conversation: “I once met a man who said he could not understand Indians because an Indian had said to him that God might be represented as an elephant. Now, though I fully understand the reasons for anthropomorphism in art, I myself have always found an elephant the most natural symbol.”<br><br>‘He had kinds of knowledge that one would not have suspected. Years ago some illustrated paper published a reproduction of a supposedly Diabolist picture of the Annunciation. Most of us said we could see nothing wrong in it. Benecke (in a low voice): “Look at that hand.” We: “Why, what does that mean?” Benecke (with a contraction of his lip and forehead suggesting actual physical pain): “Oh, something very bad indeed.” He made it clear that the subject was now closed.<br><br>‘He could, especially in his later years, be extremely formidable. This side of him cannot be represented in writing because what counted was not the words he said but the look in his face.<br><br>‘It was almost impossible to make Benecke recognise one’s ignorance of anything he happened to be talking about. He and I usually came out of chapel together and went to breakfast in the Common Room. He would stand by the fire reading the morning paper and presently announce in a low voice: “I see Mrs. X. is dead.” I would reply: “Mrs. X? I’m afraid I don’t know her.” “Oh!” he would say (with some severity), “surely you didn’t think I meant Mrs Norman X?<br><br>‘Often Benecke, J.A. Smith, J.T. Christie and I breakfasted together. Christie said: “The conversation of J.A. and Benecke is like what Ouida’s idea of donnish conversation would be, e.g. J.A.: ‘Benecke, what do you regard as the Vocative of Cleisthenes?’ P.V.M.B. (demurely): ‘Well, it depends on which Cleisthenes you mean.’ J.A. (with deep indignation): ‘Oh Cleisthenes of Trebizond of course.’ They irritated each other a little.”<br><br>‘Benecke had a clerical friend who used to come and pay him longer visits than were quite welcome. As Benecke generally came to breakfast a little earlier than his guest, I could tell from the way in which he spoke of him how his feelings were progressing. On the second morning he would refer to him as “my guest X.” On the third he had become “the Vicar of Z.” But on one occasion the visit lasted so long that Benecke referred to him as “the distinguished subject of our previous conversation.”<br><br>‘Benecke was a teetotaller when I knew him, but remarked: “If I were tempted to drink too much of anything it would be brandy. I always picture Nectar as brandy when I read about it in poetry.”<br><br>He told me that when he first visited Berlin as a young man there was no recognised dinner hour. He called on some of his relatives at 12 o’clock and to his horror was received with the words: “Ach! There is the young Paul from England who has so friendly himself to dinner invited.” After a very heavy meal he left the house and decided that a longish walk was what he needed. This brought him at about 6 o’clock to a neighborhood in the suburbs where he remembered that he had some other relatives he ought to call on. No sooner had he been shown in that he received exactly the same greeting and found himself sitting down to another and even larger dinner.<br><br>‘The state of his clothes, and especially his collars, often went beyond all ordinary limits of donnish shabbiness. Someone advanced the hypothesis that personal vanity (he was extremely, classically handsome) had been a temptation of his youth and that he had been mortifying it ever  since. But I think he was wholly unconscious of his clothes. There was a story of new collars being smuggled into his chambers by the connivance of his scout and the benevolence of a colleague, and he is said not to have noticed.<br><br>‘Benecke had a most insensitive skin: so insensitive that he said he regarded a mustard plaster as a pleasure because it gave him traces of sensation on the surface of his body where he usually had none. On one occasion within my memory he stood in front of the Common Room fire till two holes were burnt right through his trousers on each calf, and went away unconscious of the fact. It was discovered by his colleagues only because he went about for some days with a white patch on each calf which we at first supposed to be a stain of flour or whitewash. It was really his underclothes showing through the holes in his trouser legs.’",

Things need to be treated at length not in so far as they are great but in so far as they are complicated. Good books which are remote from modern sympathy need to be treated at greater length than good books which everyone already knows and loves. Bad books may be of importance for the history of taste and if they are passed over too briefly the student’s picture of a period may be distorted. Finally, if I had worked strictly to scale I should have been forced either to leave out many minor authors altogether (as roads and small rivers could not be made visible in maps unless their width were exaggerated) or else to say more on some great authors not because more needed to be said but for the sake of proportion.<br><br>Where I have quoted from neo-Latin authors I have tried to translate them into sixteenth-century English, not simply for the fun of it but to guard the reader from a false impression he might otherwise receive.

What I remember is something as boisterous, often as discomposing but always as fresh and tonic, as a high wind. Janie was the delight and terror of a little Strandtown and Belmont circle, now almost extinct. I remember wild walks on the (still unspoilt) Holywood hills, preposterous jokes shouted through the gale across half a field, extravagantly merry (yet also Lucullan) lunches and suppers at Lisnadene, devastating raillery, the salty tang of an immensely vivid personality. She was a religious woman, a true, sometimes a grim, daughter of the Kirk; no less certainly, the broadest-spoken maiden lady in the Six Counties. She was a born satirist. Every kind of sham and self-righteousness was her butt. She deflated the unco-gude with a single ironic phrase, then a moment’s silence, then the great gust of her laughter. She laughed with her whole body. When I consider how all this was maintained through years of increasing loneliness, pain, disability, and inevitable frustration I am inclined to say she had a soul as brave and uncomplaining as any I ever knew.

I hope they did not hasten its death, but they certainly lost it one reader. A country clergyman wrote to the editor, withdrawing his subscription on the ground that “much of the advice given in these letters seemed to him not only erroneous but positively diabolical.”<br><br>In general, however, they had a reception I had never dreamed of. Reviews were either laudatory or filled with that sort of anger which tells an author that he has hit his target; sales were at first (by my standards) prodigious, and have continued steady.<br><br>Of course, sales do not always mean what authors hope. If you gauged the amount of Bible reading in England by the number of Bibles sold, you would go far astray. Sales of <i>The Screwtape Letters,</i> in their own little way, suffer from a similar ambiguity. It is the sort of book that gets given to godchildren, the sort that gets read aloud at retreats. It is even, as I have noticed with a chastened smile, the sort that gravitates towards spare bedrooms, there to live a life of undisturbed tranquillity in company with <i>The Road Mender, John Inglesant,</i> and <i>The Life of the Bee.</i> Sometimes it is bought for even more humiliating reasons. A lady whom I knew discovered that the pretty little probationer who filled her hot-water bottle in the hospital had read <i>Screwtape.</i> She also discovered why.<br><br>“You see,” said the girl, “we were warned that at interviews, after the real, technical questions are over, matrons and people sometimes ask about your general interests. The best thing is to say you’ve read something. So they gave us a list of about ten books that usually go down pretty well and said we ought to read at least one of them.”<br><br>“And you chose <i>Screwtape</i>?”<br><br>“Well, of course; it was the shortest.”<br><br>Still, when all allowances have been made, the book has had readers of the genuine sort sufficiently numerous to make it worthwhile answering some of the questions it has raised in their minds.<br><br>The commonest question is whether I really “believe in the Devil.”<br><br>Now, if by “the Devil” you mean a power opposite to God and, like God, self-existent from all eternity, the answer is certainly No. There is no uncreated being except God. God has no opposite. No being could attain a “perfect badness” opposite to the perfect goodness of God; for when you have taken away every kind of good thing (intelligence, will, memory, energy, and existence itself) there would be none of him left.<br><br>The proper question is whether I believe in devils. I do. That is to say, I believe in angels, and I believe that some of these, by the abuse of their free will, have become enemies to God and, as a corollary, to us. These we may call devils. They do not differ in nature from good angels, but their nature is depraved. <i>Devil</i> is the opposite of <i>angel</i> only as Bad Man is the opposite of Good Man. Satan, the leader or dictator of devils, is the opposite, not of God, but of Michael.<br><br>I believe this not in the sense that it is part of my creed, but in the sense that it is one of my opinions. My religion would not be in ruins if this opinion were shown to be false. Till that happens—and proofs of a negative are hard to come by—I shall retain it. It seems to me to explain a good many facts. It agrees with the plain sense of Scripture, the tradition of Christendom, and the beliefs of most men at most times. And it conflicts with nothing that any of the sciences has shown to be true.<br><br>It should be (but it is not) unnecessary to add that a belief in angels, whether good or evil, does not mean a belief in either as they are represented in art and literature. Devils are depicted with bats’ wings and good angels with birds’ wings, not because anyone holds that moral deterioration would be likely to turn feathers into membrane, but because most men like birds better than bats. They are given wings at all in order to suggest the swiftness of unimpeded intellectual energy. They are given human form because man is the only rational creature we know. Creatures higher in the natural order than ourselves, either incorporeal or animating bodies of a sort we cannot experience, must be represented symbolically if they are to be represented at all.<br><br>These forms are not only symbolical but were always known to be symbolical by reflective people. The Greeks did not believe that the gods were really like the beautiful human shapes their sculptors gave them. In their poetry a god who wishes to “appear” to a mortal temporarily assumes the likeness of a man. Christian theology has nearly always explained the “appearance” of an angel in the same way. It is only the ignorant, said Dionysius in the fifth century, who dream that spirits are really winged men.<br><br>In the plastic arts these symbols have steadily degenerated. Fra Angelico’s angels carry in their face and gesture the peace and authority of Heaven. Later come the chubby infantile nudes of Raphael; finally the soft, slim, girlish, and consolatory angels of nineteenth century art, shapes so feminine that they avoid being voluptuous only by their total insipidity—the frigid houris of a teatable paradise. They are a pernicious symbol. In Scripture the visitation of an angel is always alarming; it has to begin by saying “Fear not.” The Victorian angel looks as if it were going to say, “There, there.”<br><br>The literary symbols are more dangerous because they are not so easily recognised as symbolical. Those of Dante are the best. Before his angels we sink in awe. His devils, as Ruskin rightly remarked, in their rage, spite, and obscenity, are far more like what the reality must be than anything in Milton. Milton’s devils, by their grandeur and high poetry, have done great harm, and his angels owe too much to Homer and Raphael. But the really pernicious image is Goethe’s Mephistopheles. It is Faust, not he, who really exhibits the ruthless, sleepless, unsmiling concentration upon self which is the mark of Hell. The humorous, civilised, sensible, adaptable Mephistopheles has helped to strengthen the illusion that evil is liberating.<br><br>A little man may sometimes avoid some single error made by a great one, and I was determined that my own symbolism should at least not err in Goethe’s way. For humor involves a sense of proportion and a power of seeing yourself from the outside. Whatever else we attribute to beings who sinned through pride, we must not attribute this. Satan, said Chesterton, fell through force of gravity. We must picture Hell as a state where everyone is perpetually concerned about his own dignity and advancement, where everyone has a grievance, and where everyone lives the deadly serious passions of envy, self-importance, and resentment. This, to begin with. For the rest, my own choice of symbols depended, I suppose, on temperament and on the age.<br><br>I like bats much better than bureaucrats. I live in the Managerial Age, in a world of “Admin.” The greatest evil is not now done in those sordid “dens of crime” that Dickens loved to paint. It is not done even in concentration camps and labour camps. In those we see its final result. But it is conceived and ordered (moved, seconded, carried, and minuted) in clean, carpeted, warmed, and well-lighted offices, by quiet men with white collars and cut fingernails and smooth-shaven cheeks who do not need to raise their voice. Hence, naturally enough, my symbol for Hell is something like the bureaucracy of a police state or the offices of a thoroughly nasty business concern.<br><br>Milton has told us that “devil with devil damned Firm concord holds.” But how? Certainly not by friendship. A being which can still love is not yet a devil. Here again my symbol seemed to me useful. It enabled me, by earthly parallels, to picture an official society held together entirely by fear and greed. On the surface, manners are normally suave. Rudeness to one’s superiors would obviously be suicidal; rudeness to one’s equals might put them on their guard before you were ready to spring your mine. For of course “Dog eat dog” is the principle of the whole organisation. Everyone wishes everyone else’s discrediting, demotion, and ruin; everyone is an expert in the confidential report, the pretended alliance, the stab in the back. Over all this their good manners, their expressions of grave respect, their “tributes” to one another’s invaluable services form a thin crust. Every now and then it gets punctured, and the scalding lava of their hatred spurts out.<br><br>This symbol also enabled me to get rid of the absurd fancy that devils are engaged in the disinterested pursuit of something called Evil (the capital is essential). Mine have no use for any such turnip ghost. Bad angels, like bad men, are entirely practical. They have two motives. The first is fear of punishment: for as totalitarian countries have their camps for torture, so my Hell contains deeper Hells, its “houses of correction.” Their second motive is a kind of hunger. I feign that devils can, in a spiritual sense, eat one another; and us. Even in human life we have seen the passion to dominate, almost to digest, one’s fellow; to make his whole intellectual and emotional life merely an extension of one’s own—to hate one’s hatreds and resent one’s grievances and indulge one’s egoism through him as well as through oneself. His own little store of passion must of course be suppressed to make room for ours. If he resists this suppression he is being very selfish.<br><br>On Earth this desire is often called “love.” In Hell I feign that they recognise it as hunger. But there the hunger is more ravenous, and a fuller satisfaction is possible. There, I suggest, the stronger spirit—there are perhaps no bodies to impede the tion—can really and irrevocably suck the weaker into itself and permanently gorge its own being on the weaker’s outraged individuality. It is (I feign) for this that devils desire human souls and the souls of one another. It is for this that Satan desires all his own followers and all the sons of Eve and all the host of Heaven. His dream is of the day when all shall be inside him and all that says “I” can say it only through him. This, I surmise, is the bloated-spider parody, the only imitation he can understand, of that unfathomed bounty whereby God turns tools into servants and servants into sons, so that they may be at last reunited to Him in the perfect freedom of a love offered from the height of the utter individualities which he has liberated them to be.<br><br>But, as in Grimm’s story, <i>des träumte mir nur,</i> this is all only myth and symbol. That is why the question of my own opinion about devils, though proper to be answered when once it was raised, is really of very minor importance for a reader of <i>Screwtape.</i> To those who share that opinion, my devils will be symbols of a concrete reality: to others, they will be personifications of abstractions, and the book will be an allegory. But it makes little difference which way you read it. For of course its purpose was not to speculate about diabolical life but to throw light from a new angle on the life of men.<br><br>I am told that I was not first in the field and that someone in the seventeenth century wrote letters from a devil. I have not seen that book. I believe its slant was mainly political. But I gladly acknowledge a debt to Stephen McKenna’s <i>The Confessions of a Well-Meaning Woman.</i> The connection may not be obvious, but you will find there the same moral inversion—the blacks all white and the whites all black —and the humour which comes of speaking through a totally humourless <i>persona.</i> I think my idea of spiritual cannibalism probably owes something to the horrible scenes of “absorbing” in David Lindsay’s neglected <i>Voyage to Arcturus.</i><br><br>The names of my devils have excited a good deal of curiosity, and there have been many explanations, all wrong. The truth is that I aimed merely at making them nasty—and here too I am perhaps indebted to Lindsay—by the sound. Once a name was invented, I might speculate like anyone else (and with no more authority than anyone else) as to the phonetic associations which caused the unpleasant effect. I fancy that <i>Scrooge, screw, thumbscrew, tapeworm,</i> and <i>red tape</i> all do some work in my hero’s name, and that <i>slob, slobber, slubber</i>, and <i>gob</i> have all gone into <i>slubgob.</i><br><br>Some have paid me an undeserved compliment by supposing that my <i>Letters</i> were the ripe fruit of many years’ study in moral and ascetic theology. They forgot that there is an equally reliable, though less creditable, way of learning how temptation works. “My heart”—I need no other’s — “showeth me the wickedness of the ungodly.”<br><br>I was often asked or advised to add to the original <i>Letters,</i> but for many years I felt not the least inclination to do it. Though I had never written anything more easily, I never wrote with less enjoyment. The ease came, no doubt, from the fact that the device of diabolical letters, once you have thought of it, exploits itself spontaneously, like Swift’s big and little men, or the medical and ethical philosophy of <i>Erewhon,</i> or Anstey’s <i>Garuda Stone.</i> It would run away with you for a thousand pages if you gave it its head. But though it was easy to twist one’s mind into the diabolical attitude, it was not fun, or not for long. The strain produced a sort of spiritual cramp. The work into which I had to project myself while I spoke through Screwtape was all dust, grit, thirst, and itch. Every trace of beauty, freshness, and geniality had to be excluded. It almost smothered me before I was done. It would have smothered my readers if I had prolonged it.<br><br>I had, moreover, a sort of grudge against my book for not being a different book which no one could write. Ideally, Screwtape’s advice to Wormwood should have been balanced by archangelical advice to the patient’s guardian angel. Without this the picture of human life is lopsided. But who could supply the deficiency? Even if a man—and he would have to be a far better man than I—could scale the spiritual heights required, what “answerable style” could he use? For the style would really be part of the content. Mere advice would be no good; every sentence would have to smell of Heaven. And nowadays even if you could write a prose like Traherne’s, you wouldn’t be allowed to, for the canon of “functionalism” has disabled literature for half its functions. (At bottom, every ideal of style dictates not only how we should say things but what sort of things we may say.)<br><br>Then, as years went on and the stifling experience of writing the <i>Letters</i> became a weaker memory, reflections on this and that which seemed somehow to demand Screwtapian treatment began to occur to me. I was resolved never to write another <i>Letter.</i> The idea of something like a lecture or “address” hovered vaguely in my mind, now forgotten, now recalled, never written. Then came an invitation from the <i>Saturday Evening Post,</i> and that pressed the trigger.<br><br>[In 1962 the text was signed and dated:]<br>C.S.

His early lyrics contained perhaps his most unique contribution to the literature of the period, but “Jason” & the “Earthly Paradise”, were the works of his maturity and probably destined to enjoy the greater popularity. As a teller of tales he yielded to none except Homer. In his prose works he had endeavoured, with some success, to recall the melody and charm of Malory.<br><br>After the interval the usual informal discussion followed. The general sense of the Society was that rather too high a position had been claimed for William Morris. Dr. Carlyle  observed that in his early lyrical work Morris had probably been writing in a style which was not really natural to him under the influence of Rossetti. Other members commented on the lack of original thought and “high seriousness” in the poet’s work. The Society then adjourned after fixing the place of its next meeting. <br><br> [14 June 1919:]<br><br>The Society thanked Mr. Hartman for his enthusiastic and sympathetic criticism, and after the interval discussed the theory of realism—the discussion soon passing, by paths which the present writer at least has never been able to retrace, into the metaphysical question of “abstract values”. Mr. Pasley  was adamantine in refusing to allow more than subjective reality to merit in any sphere whatsoever. The meeting then adjourned, after Mr. Watling  had endeavoured to carry a rule that the patrons of the subjective theory should in future be compelled to insert the words TO ME after every adjective they had occasion to use. <br><br>[According to Hooper, “Added sometime later are the words:”]<br><br>Without success.",

        textProvided: "[{16-18} On Greeves’s parents, followed by an apology for not describing Arthur himself:]<br><br>Joseph was a Plymouth Brother, and one of a large and wealthy family in Belfast, who claimed to have been members of this sect for many generations. He was a tall, straight sort of a man, severe in his dress and in his expression. I have been told he was handsome in his youth, and his beard, when I knew him, did not conceal a certain cold and heavy regularity of features which might have been admired if you could forgive them for their lack of all that makes a face alive. ‘There was no speculation in his eyes’—the face, like the man, was timid, prim, sour, at once oppressed and oppressive. He was a harsh husband and a despotic father. His wife was ‘in tears half the time’ while he lived, as one of his sons told me. He died of anaemia. In his declining years his habits became very gross, and I have heard that he commonly broke wind without restraint in the presence of his wife and children. My own father described his funeral as ‘the most cheerful funeral he ever attended’.<br><br>Outside his own house, he was civil and even friendly, as far as his powers would let him be. He had however no conversation. Even on religious subjects he was a deadweight, and my father thought his knowledge of Scripture by no means extensive. I have heard that at [17] family prayers in his own house, where he daily read and then expounded a passage from the Bible, he went over and over the same passages and gave always the same explanations. His chief intellectual interests were those of an antiquary, and he had on his shelves a few volumes of local history and archaeology. It is also worth recording that his was the only private house in which I have ever seen a copy of Alison’s <i>French Revolution,</i> a work endlessly familiar in the secondhand bookshops of my day. He was also a sportsman, and sometimes went shooting on the islands of Strangford Lough.<br><br>His wife had unmistakably been a beauty in her youth, and was a comely matron when I first remember her. Her character is not easy to describe. I think it changed a good deal during the period of my acquaintance with her. Her sincere and almost motherly affection for myself was however the same at the end as at the beginning. This perhaps gave the key to one side of her nature. She was (at first sight—or shall I say, at certain periods) the very type of the simple, warm hearted, confiding wife and mother. ‘All was conscience and tendre herte.’ Such was her naivete that she would pour out to any acquaintance met on the road, the whole plot of the last novel she had read: and her comments on her neighbours were of such a kind that one was left wondering whether quite that amount of simplicity was possible. Could it be that the sheep’s clothing concealed a cat? Yet no sooner had you veered towards this hypothesis, than the next remark would fling you back on the original view—‘naivete, not to say mental deficiency’. Succeeding years tended to bring the truth to light, that Mrs Greeves had, with all her benevolence, a genuine streak of ill nature in her. Her unfair and partial treatment of her son John, when I last stayed in Bernagh, is the heaviest count against her. And yet, like Chaucer, ‘me ne list this silly woman chide’, for silly she was and sillier she steadily became.<br><br>Her chief reading after her husband’s death, was such books as prophesy the end of the world. One of them, I remember, opened with the remarkable BONA FIDE that indeed there had been many previous prophecies, but the difference about the present one was that it was really true. Her conversation came to consist more and more of a perpetual attempt, and a perpetual failure, to tell stories and riddles. A more complete triumph of hope over experience it would be impossible to imagine. NEVER ONCE have I heard her reach the end of her anecdote without either missing the point or frankly breaking down—but with scarcely a pause she would embark upon another. If stories ceased for a moment, she would talk about the Kaiser—for whom, years after the war, she retained the pious hatred of 1915. I once remarked to her that we must remember the bad upbringing he had had. She replied, ‘I don’t want to hear anything of that sort.’ The nearest meeting between her religious and patriotic views was a half tearful complaint, ‘And yet it says you ought to forgive your enemies!’ …I do not know how it is—Mrs Greeves was a better woman than any true account of her would lead you to believe. Much she did that was bad, and all that she said was foolish: but somehow it was all forgiveable. One does not love the domestic cat less because it is greedy and thievish. Somehow these facts do not reach the heart of the mystery.<br><br>The children all (I believe) abandoned the religion of their parents. They had all been subjected to a baptism by total immersion EN MASSE when the youngest was about 12. It had been carried out in the bathroom where the young men, the young woman, and the boys, in their bathing suits, had been plunged one by one in a bath of tepid water. But I do not think that their religion had at any time been practised with much devotion by the younger generation. Certainly all, except Willie, bore the ugly marks of ex-Puritanism—of those who are brought up in a crude antithesis of Grace and Nature, and who therefore, when they abandon the Grace, straightway become startlingly natural. All revealed each passing sensation of greed, jealousy, anger, pleasure, or disappointment in an almost savage nakedness. Their upbringing gave them no HUMANE tradition to turn to when once their theology was gone.<br><br>Of Arthur, the youngest child, I shall give no account. He is, after my brother, my oldest and most intimate friend. I know more of him than any historian has a right to know of his subject, and I therefore leave him to those [who] can discover his faults more properly and his virtues less partially than I.<br><br>[{24-26} On Arthur Greeves:]<br><br>My refusal to draw the character of Arthur Greeves has resulted in a portrait of him by another hand, which justice and charity oblige me to supplement. I do not contradict it, nor do I accuse it of malice. It is the work of one who knew the subject less intimately than myself and who saw only the surface of a character whose faults lay very obvious to the eye.<br><br>Arthur was the youngest son of a doting mother and a harsh father, two evils whereof each increased the other. The mother soothed him the more, to compensate for the father’s harshness, and the father became harsher to counteract the ill effects of the mother’s indulgence. Both thus conspired to aggravate a tendency (not rare in human nature) towards self pity, and some supernumerary bullying from an older brother was hardly likely to cure it. It can easily be imagined how such a child grew up: but who could have foretold that he would be neither a liar nor a tale bearer, neither a coward nor a misanthrope? He was the frankest of men. Many of the most ludicrous episodes which could be told against him, turn on his failure to acquire that ‘visor to the human face’ which such a training usually teaches a man to wear. He was the most faithful of friends, and carried the innumerable secrets of my own furtive and ignoble adolescence locked in a silence which is not commonly thought effeminate. Under illness or inconvenience he was impatient—a loud and violent, but not a lengthy grumbler: but danger left him unmoved. He was careless of heights and as a motorist was a rash though surprisingly competent driver. He was much isolated from his fellow men, not only by real and supposed ill health, but by literary and artistic tastes which none of his family and few of his neighbours shared.<br><br>Until I met him, and during my frequent absences, his position was much the same as that of an imaginative boy in one of our public schools. Yet he never showed any inclination to revenge himself after the fashion so familiar among our modern intelligentsia. He continued to feel—indeed he taught me to endeavour to feel with him—at once a human affection and a rich aesthetic relish for his antediluvian aunts,  [25]  his mill-owning uncles, his mother’s servants, the postman on our roads, and the cottagers whom we met in our walks. What he called the ‘Homely’ was the natural food both of his heart and his imagination. A bright hearth seen through an open door as we passed, a train of ducks following a brawny farmer’s wife, a drill of cabbages in a suburban garden—these were things that never failed to move him, even to an ecstasy, and he never found them incompatible with his admiration for Proust, or Wyndham Lewis, or Picasso.<br><br>He was completely unworldly. He never in his life read an ‘advanced’ book or imitated a ‘modern’ painter because he felt that he could thus become a superior being. The motive was always either his genuine pleasure in them, or else the advice of ill-chosen friends. For Arthur was both humble and unstable. He could be persuaded to read, or at least begin, any book: to adopt (for a time) any canon of taste. The last speaker was always right to him. But all these fluctuations went on over a fundamental constancy: to the charm of the ‘homely’ he was never untrue, and if he was easily drawn into the follies of any and every coterie, he could not, by any process, be infected with its pride.<br><br>During the earlier years of our acquaintance he was (as always) a Christian, and I was an atheist. But though (God forgive me) I bombarded him with all the thin artillery of a seventeen year old rationalist, I never made any impression on his faith—a faith both vague and confused, and in some ways too indulgent to our common weaknesses, but inexpugnable. He remains victor in that debate. It is I who have come round. The thing is symbolical of much in our joint history. He was not a clever boy, he was even a dull boy; I was a scholar. He had no ‘ideas’. I bubbled over with them. It might seem that I had much to give him, and that he had nothing to give me. But this is not the truth. I could give concepts, logic, facts, arguments, but he had feelings  to offer, feelings which most mysteriously—for he was always very inarticulate—he taught me to share. Hence, in our commerce, I dealt in superficies, but he in solids. I learned charity from him and failed,  for all my efforts, to teach him arrogance in return.<br><br>And since I have mentioned charity, I must speak of his ‘charity’ in the narrower sense. This was all his own, all virtue, and no nature. Heredity and early training had laid upon him as a natural curse the love of money, but he conquered it. He came to support, almost entirely, an unemployed man, and to offer me assistance in my lean times. He came (perhaps a harder thing for a constitutionally lazy man) to discharge regular duties in a charitable organisation. In this respect he defeated his nature. Against gluttony—another hereditary vice—he was less successful: he remained always a valetudinarian, though he was as much the dupe of doctors as of his self pity.<br><br>But if I had to write his epitaph, I should say of him what I could say of no one else known to me—‘He despised nothing.’ Contempt—if not the worst, surely the most ludicrously inappropriate of the sins that [26] men commit—was, I believe, unknown to him. He fulfilled the Gospel precept: he ‘judged not’.",

        textProvided: "“Screwtape Proposes a Toast” was written years after the original <i>Screwtape Letters</i>. It takes over from them the technique of what may be called diabolical ventriloquism. Screwtape’s outlook is like a photographic negative; his whites are our blacks and whatever he welcomes we ought to dread. But in the original <i>Letters</i> this device was applied to the religious and moral life of an individual. In the “Toast” the main subject is education.<br><br>In my view there is a sense in which education ought to be democratic and another sense in which it ought not. It ought to be democratic in the sense of being available, without distinction, of sex, colour, class, race or religion, to all who can—and will—diligently accept it. But once the young people are inside the school there must be no attempt to establish a factitious egalitarianism between the idlers and dunces on the one hand and the clever and industrious on the other. A modern nation needs a very large class of genuinely educated people and it is the primary function of schools and universities to supply them. To lower standards or disguise inequalities is fatal. <br><br>If this sounds harsh, I would observe that the opposite policy is really devised to soothe the inferiority complex not of the idlers and dunces but of their parents. Do not be in the least afraid that those who live out their school-days—which should be brief—on the back bench of the lowest class will suffer any trauma when they see promotion and honours and official approval going to the diligent minority. They are stronger than it. They can punch its head and kick its stern. All the distinctions they really care about—the popularity and the success in games—go not to it but to them. They enjoy their school-days very much. Our real problem is to see that they impede as little as possible the purposes for which school really exists. <br><br>So far so good. But I had to face a tactical difficulty. The “Toast” was published in an American magazine. [152] The tendency in education which I was deploring has gone further in America than anywhere else. If I had been writing “straight” my article would have been an attack on the “public schools” of America. It would indeed have raised nothing that educated Americans do not fully admit. But it is one thing for them to say these things of their own country and another to hear them said by a foreigner! I therefore thought it neither good manners nor good tactics to make my point quite nakedly. Instead, I resorted to a further level of irony. Screwtape in fact describes American education; he affects to be holding the English education up as the awful example. The most intelligent of my American readers would, I hoped, see the game I was playing and enjoy the joke. And if those who were a little duller really believed that “democratic” education (in the true sense) had gone even further in England, they could not help seeing that their actual system was at least uncomfortably like the one Screwtape describes—and draw the moral. <br><br>C.S.

One inky fourth former can make another inky fourth former understand what an adult cannot make him understand. The two boys speak the same language and have the same difficulties. The boy at your elbow [379] knows your difficulty because it was his difficulty yesterday or perhaps half an hour ago. The master very often does not. When you ask him for an explanation he often explains very clearly and at great length all the things you understand already and leaves out the thing you wanted to have explained. The reason usually is that your difficulty about that one thing arises from a misunderstanding so elementary that he never suspected it. There are, in fact, certain kinds of help you can get only from a person on your own level. That is my only excuse for writing a book on prayer.<br><br>[In that manuscript Lewis also began a paragraph three times with the sentence:]<br><br>I now turn from prayer considered as Request to prayer considered as Adoration.<br><br>[In another passage, discussing the]<br><br>Agnostic’s view of prayer<br><br>[he said:]<br><br>The modern man who has come to Christianity as an adult may begin to feel uncomfortable. Are we not making our relation to our Creator far too Personal? … And if this is so, is it not really ‘putting back the clock’ to re-introduce a crudely personal approach on the highest level of all? Is not prayer simply the last survival of savage, pre-philosophical, thinking?<br><br>Now for certain people at certain moments this objection is positively a healthy one. Some who have always been Christians, and whose adult prayers are still much too like the prayers they made in childhood, who still in their heart of hearts think of God only as a Big Man in the sky, may easily take the idea of prayer far too much for granted. The possibility of personal intercourse between the little, hairless bipeds called Men and the inconceivable, self-existent Being which underlies all phenomena [380] and all space and time, may seem to such people nothing surprising, nothing that we had not a right to expect. If the fact that it appears outrageous to those who have had a purely scientific upbringing startles any such Christian into the realization that, in a sense, it really is outrageous, not to be thought of without amazement and trembling, then it will have done him good. There is a certain type of Christian (I suspect I am of that type myself) who often needs to learn reverence from a certain type of Agnostic.",

The rest of the fragment attempts to articulate and assert his, rather melodramatic, sense of individuality. …{32} Text A also contains an account of adolescent angst that suggests an imaginative amalgamation of his schoolboy experiences at Campbell College.

There was in Shakespeare’s time no anthropology to make men believe that black men had smaller brains or skulls of the wrong shape. There was no imperialism to make men think of them as members of subject races: no recent memory of Negro slavery [to?] make men think of them as the dregs of society.<br><br>[38]<br><br>At Othello’s first entry we should have our minds quite clear both of modern arrogance about backward races and of modern enlightenment and the brotherhood of man. We must concentrate with a primitive sharpness of vision in the physical fact: a group of men coming in by torchlight and in the midst of them, monstrous, not to be got over, the staring black face and red lips—a figure equally suitable for some crude kind of mumming farce or . . . tragedy about Christian maidens imprisoned . . . far over seas.<br><br>This play is not the story of a girl who married below herself, but of a girl who married a sort of ogre or hobgoblin.<br><br>And then, at once, Shakespeare begins doing more. . . . The Black Man begins talking. He is the descendant of kings. Not “chiefs” as a modern might call them: the Elizabethans have no pictures of Kraals . . . or “native” villages in their minds. They are more likely to base ideas on Prester John and an Ethiopian of Heliodorus, and even the African kings of Ariosto, and even Melchior.<br><br>The creature is noble in its own way: none the less perilous or mysterious for that. But the idea is fascinating: it has the attraction of a good giant, or a chivalrous Turk.<br><br>[40]<br><br>We see them together for the first time: the fair, gentle, foolish, loving lady and the heroic, far-advanced blackamore, with his flash of tooth and eye. Neither here nor in later scenes where we see them embrace, must there be any physical disgust. Nor, on the other hand, must there be any watery stuff about her being quite right to love his mind rather than his face. There must be a good old ballad . . . the theme is Beauty and the Beast or the Princess and the Goblin, or Freya promised to the giants.<br><br>Production should not evade Othello’s colour by making him look like an Arab. In my opinion, it is not as important (in itself) to have a real Negro in the part. Burnt cork strikes the proper [41] note. If this note is properly struck at the outset most of the questions about Othello’s behaviour will never arise. Obviously, he may do <i>anything</i>.

In his small cursive script, complete with cross-outs and circled footnotes, Lewis considers such things as accuracy, clarity, rhythm, alliteration, and figurative language. In Psalm 11:3 he notes an illogical image. Where Coverdale has “For the foundations will be cast down,” Lewis notes:]<br><br>We can’t have what is already the lowest (foundations) cast <i>down;</i> it’s like talking about falling off the floor<br><br>[(2, n. 2). He suggests]<br><br>If the foundations be removed<br><br>[(2). Though concerned with accuracy, he is not interested in strict literalism. In Psalm 4:8 (subsequently published as 4:7) he prefers]<br><br>as joyful as<br><br>[to the accurate] <br><br><i>more joyful than, </i>which will produce an inferior rhythm <br><br>[(1, n. 1). And of Psalm 19:3 he says:]<br><br>Leave it alone: it is only <i>verbally</i> false to the original<br><br>[(5, n. 1) {52}We glanced earlier at Lewis’s suggestions for Psalms 1-41, submitted in March 1959; later he sent handwritten suggestions for Psalms 67-81 (2 pages) and 84-89 (2 pages). In all three lists his emendations, like Eliot’s, contain plenty of instances in which he says the equivalent of “Keep Coverdale’s wording.” <i>The Revised Psalter</i> (1964) contains at least six retentions of Coverdale recommended by Lewis; three others did not make the final version. One loss is in Psalm 25:4, where Coverdale has “Lead me forth in thy truth, and learn me: for thou art the God of my salvation.” Of course <i>teach</i> is the obvious modern replacement for <i>learn,</i> but Lewis objects:]<br><br>To change <i>learn</i> into <i>teach</i> wd. be pedantic pseudo scholarship.

But then he will believe the accounts which physiologists give of perception, and sooner or later will regard all the coloured and tangible shapes wh we call matter, as appearances arising in his own mind, from physiological causes. But among the appearances his own body must be caused/coloured: therefore, the whole world, including his body will be inside his mind. True, there might be another world of bodies wh caused this world of appearances: but that does not matter, for the whole argument was about the perceptible bodies. He will now have fallen into a contradiction for because he believes in his own body he has been forced to disbelieve in all bodies: but as this involved disbelief in his own body wh caused disbelief in all the rest, he has now no reason left for his disbelief: yet if he abandons it for belief he must go thro the same circle again.<br><br>While the contemplated or the enjoyed differ in kind, the material and the psychological (much of which is contemplated) are only different in tendency.

        textProvided: "In a book like this it might be expected that we should begin with the origins of language and proceed thence through prehistoric language till we come to ancient language and so finally arrive at modern language. This method undoubtedly makes a book easy to follow but it has one serious drawback. It tends to give you the impression that the things said in the later chapters are based or founded on the things said in the earlier, just as the later propositions in geometry are based on the earlier. If this impression is left to operate unchecked the reader may even come to feel that our statements about primitive or original languages are more certain than those we make about modern language, or if the former were the <i>data</i> or the latter a kind of development in reality, however, it is the opposite. We know a great deal about modern language, and less about ancient; and anything we can say about prehistoric language, can only be guesswork. The whole basis of knowledge on which that guesswork is built is our knowledge of modern language. We must therefore begin with it. Any speculations we can make about an unknown past or the unknowable beginnings must come at the end. That will help to emphasize their merely speculative character. We begin, then, with an attempt to say what language is.<br><br>A language, in the widest sense, is a system of signs. Thus there is a language of flags (used in the navy), a “language of flowers”, and so forth. But there is one such system of signs so widely used and so much richer than all the others that it generally is called simply “language.” This is the system in which the signs are the various noises made by a human mouth. It is Language in this sense, which is the subject of the present book.<br><br>But our definition is still too broad. For example, a groan or cry is a noise made by a human mouth and it may be a sign that the noise of a mouth which makes it is in pain. But it is not what we usually call language. We only see language in its full sense when the noises made not only are signs but are intended to be signs by the person who makes them.<br><br>This is sometimes expressed by saying that language is vocal noise with a meaning. This will do well enough provided that we remember, or distinguish, the different senses of the word meaning. It has at least three.<br><br>[26] 1. “That sky <i>means</i> rain”. By saying this we intend to convey that the state of the sky is a sign of rain, in the sense that it is evidence (whether certain or probable) that rain will presently begin to fall. We are not necessarily saying that crying or anything is intentionally making signs to us. We are stating grounds on which we are prepared to make a prediction.<br><br>2. “I <i>mean</i> to go to London to-morrow.” This might be translated—“I intend, propose, am resolved to go London to-morrow”. <br><br>3. “The sign = means that the two qualities are equal” or “is a sign of equality.” This must be carefully distinguished from the First [sic] sense. The two strokes are not “a sign of” equality or the same as being evidence of equality. If we take the expression a = b as evidence that a does in fact equal b that will be because we believe the writer to be a sound mathematician and an honest man. Even if the expression were quite unbelievable (e.g. 5 = 12) we should still say that the sign “meant” equality: indeed we should only know a statement to be untrue because we knew that the sign meant “equals” (if the writer was using it to mean “is less than,” his statements would no longer be untrue). Now this third kind of meaning is the one that language principally has and it is hardest to define. To mean, in this sense, is “to draw attention to,” “is present in the mind”. But that is not quite enough. A groan may draw our attention to the pain of the man who groans, and the colour of the sky may make us think of rain. But the sign = does not only in fact draw our attention to, or offer to the mind, the relation of equality, but <i>is intended</i> to do so. To mean, in this third sense is “to draw attention to not accidentally but on purpose”.<br><br>These three senses can now be distinguished as the Evidential (that the sky means rain)[,] the psychological (I mean to go to London) and the symbolical (= means equality) senses of the new meaning. We can now define language as the system of vocal noises <i>meant</i> (psychological sense) to mean (symbolic sense).<br><br>Two points had better be cleared up before we proceed.<br><br>1. Some have attempted to give what may be called an Associated account of psychological meaning. According to the sentence, “The word Radish means an edible reddish root with a hot taste” can be translated “The word Radish is so associated in my mind with the root that when I hear or read it the imagination of the word inevitably occurs to my mind”. Now it is certainly the case that words do in fact thus call into inference by association memory-images of what they mean. But it does not follow and not prove to mean much [sic] in their doing this. The writers believe that it does not. For (a) Things which are (in the symbolical sense of the word) meaningless do this quite as much as words, if not more: e.g. smells, or natural sounds. (b) in one man’s mind the [27] word “cross channel boat” may be primarily associated with a honeymoon: in another’s with being torpedoed. Yet they can understand one another when they use the word. To this those who hold the Associational theory reply that one instance does not prove that meaning is something quite distinct from Association, but only that the meaning is a special selection from the images associated with the word. Thus both men have dozens of associations with <i>cross-channel boat,</i> but each person has to select from the word that limited number of associations which is required for ordinary talk. But this seems to amount to giving up the Associational theory altogether. For if we ask <i>what</i> selection is required, surely we must answer “That selection which the word is <i>intended</i> to call up when used by speakers who know English.” What makes this the thing meant by the word is not the mere fact that they are called up but knowledge that the other speaker intends to call them up. In talking with children or imbeciles we do sometimes find that our words are merely evoking associations: we ask “Has your mother gone out” and are told “Mother made a cake to-day.” The impossibility of any real conversation on such terms helps to show how far meaning is from mere association.<br><br>2. Although language is the system of vocal noises meant (psychological sense) to mean (symbolical sense) yet of course most language, quite apart from the speaker’s intention also “means” in the first sense, the evidential. Thus the tone of the speaker’s voice may be evidence for all sorts of things which are distinct from what he means (in the symbolical sense). Or the mere fact of his saying a certain thing may be a sign of, be evidence for, something else. “He says he’s got a headache[,] that means he is afraid to come up the mountain.[”] This may be perfectly true if we know our man; the excuse may be good evidence for his fear. But obviously the words “I am ill” do not mean “I am afraid” in the symbolical sense, nor does the speaker mean (in a psychological sense) to tell us that he is afraid. Conversely, noises which are not ordinarily symbolical may be used with the intention of conveying information to us. A man may groan for the expressed purpose of letting us know that he is in pain. In this case the kind of noise which normally has a meaning only in case I (the Evidential) is being temporarily pressed into service as Language and given a symbolical meaning.<br><br>Let us now return to our definition of language as a system of vocal noises meant (sense I) to mean (sense III). Before this will quite do, a further distinction has to be made. If we went out for a walk with a man and he suddenly utters the single word “Table” we should probably ask him what he meant. We might go on to say that the word “Table” all by itself is meaningless. And in one sense, so it is. In another sense we know perfectly well that the word [28] Table has a meaning and after a little patience, we could all say what it meant. It begins to look as if single words (or at any rate some single words) have meaning in one sense, and sentences have meaning in some different sense. <br><br>This suspicion is later borne out by the following fact. If a man utters a sentence which contains a word we don’t know, we tend to ask him what <i>that word means</i>. But if he utters a sentence which we don’t understand (though we know all the words in it) we are much more likely to ask him what <i>he means</i>.<br><br>Before going any further it will be well to issue an emphatic warning against what the authors consider to be one wrong conception of the problem. It is a very tempting one. The temptation is to say that the single word, or at any rate the words mean things, as the sentences mean thoughts. Thus table can mean a piece of furniture but “There is a bigger table in the next room” would mean that the speaker has a mental picture of the next room with the bigger table in it, and that he was mentally connecting the idea of the room with the idea of the bigger table, or that he was (as the logicians say) “judging” that the next room contains a bigger table. Now what is true is that unless he is lying, he probably has the mental picture, and certainly connects the ideas and certainly makes the judgment. His uttering the sentence is therefore evidence for the dates or events in his own mind: that is it means (evidential sense) that they are occurring. But does it also mean this in the symbolical sense? It would appear not. For if that were so we should never be talking about anything but our own states of mind. And though it is clear that we are sometimes talking about our own states of mind, it is also quite clear that we often talk about other things. Indeed we often contrast our own states of mind with the thing. The man says “There is a bigger table in the next room.” His friend may rudely reply “So <i>you</i> think.” “Of course I do,” he may retort, “otherwise I wouldn’t have said so. But I’ll show you in a moment that the room is as I thought.” (It might of course be maintained by certain philosophers that what we call Things are only a special kind of thought, but we need not bother with that question here. It would still remain true and we often talk about that special kind of thought which one calls Things, and not talk about the kind purposely called “states of our own minds[”.])",

        textProvided: "A Pagan contemporary of S. Paul or of S. Augustine must have been surprised when he first looked into Christian writings at the extent to which these authors are pre-occupied with polemics, not against Paganism, but against other sects of Christianity. He would have learned with amazement that a group of cognate movements which he had hitherto classed together was involved in violent internal dissension. He would have realised, for the [32] first time, the eagerness of the orthodox teachers not only to establish their doctrine as against the prevalent philosophies of ancient civilisation but also to distinguish it and disentangle it as clearly as possible from all those other doctrines which bore a superficial resemblance to it. A similar surprise awaits the modern who turns for the first time to study the writings of the Bolshevists. Here again we find the same zeal for orthodoxy: here again, when we first look carefully, we see the sharp antagonisms of a group of movements which we ignorant outsiders had roughly classed together. I, at least, must confess that I had hitherto thought of extreme democracy, Bolshevism, Menshevism and the rest as things differing in degree but not in kind. I had supposed that they were all simply shades of the colour red, which remained homogenous in all its variations from blood crimson to the pink of a rosebud. It was therefore an enlightenment to me to read Lenin’s little work on The State and Revolution. Where I had looked for attacks on Capitalism I found attacks on Official Socialism, Anarchism and the school of Kautsky:  and the author is as bitter against these revolutionary heretics as against the capitalists themselves. No doubt this antagonism between groups whose likeness seems to us so much more important than their difference may at first raise a smile. But if we go no further than the smile we should be as foolish as our imaginary Roman would have been if he had dismissed with contempt the distinctions of early Christian orthodoxy and early Christian heresy. It is natural for a movement to wish to be itself: and no difference is too small for men who believe that vital principles are involved. We must understand before we can criticize: and for this reason it is worth while to study orthodox Bolshevism at first hand in the pages of Lenin himself.<br><br>Lenin’s little book “The State and Revolution” was composed in the August and September of 1917. It was interrupted by his own share in The Russian crisis, an interruption which, as the author tells us “can only be welcomed” since “it is more pleasant and more useful to live through  the experience of a revolution than to write about it.” The main purpose of the book is to recall revolutionary thinkers to what the author regards as genuine revolutionary doctrine, and to warn them against the corruptions of that doctrine by those whom he denounces as “Opportunist” or “Official” socialists. Under this designation he includes the Austrian Kautsky (of whom I shall have something to say presently) and the English Fabians. For the actual Labour party in England to day he would doubtless find a harder name.<br><br>Lenin bases his teaching on the work of the nineteenth century communist writers, Karl Marx and Engels: those “wells of purest Bolshevism undefiled” of whom he always speaks with profound reverence. They are, in fact, his scriptures, his canonical books, whose priceless doctrine must be preserved intact. According to Lenin this doctrine is in great danger of being diluted or as he says “vulgarised”: for it is a favourite device of the bourgeoisie first [33] to emasculate and then to honour with lip service the teaching of a revolutionary whom they had persecuted in his life. This in fact is what the Kautsky school are now doing with Marx and Engels.<br><br>To combat this tendency Lenin re-states in all its original vigour the fundamental attitude of Marx and Engels  towards the state. Their doctrine is profoundly interesting. Just as Hobbes, Rousseau and Spinoza had done, so Marx and Engels in their turn attempt to explain the origin of the state. Like Hobbes and Spinoza they look back to an earlier stage of society when the state did not exist. How, then, and why did it come into existence? Hobbes and Spinoza had answered this question very simply. In the state of nature which preceded the political state there was a continual collision of wills, resulting in a permanent condition of war: and men, to escape from such an intolerable inconvenience,  resolved themselves into a political organism by a species of contract. (Each man forfeited his natural right of murdering his neighbour in return for the political right of being safe from murder himself.) Marx and Engels, on the other hand, do not regard the primitive society as a condition of war. The purely non-political, tribal life is, for them, a condition of peace and harmony and indeed, if I mistake not, the golden age. In such a condition the state could not come into existence and would have no purpose to serve. It is only when a given society has become hopelessly entangled that the need for the state, and the state itself appear. That which produces the entanglement is class antagonism. When a society  has fallen apart into classes with opposite interests a repressive force becomes necessary. But we must not suppose (and Lenin is very emphatic on this point) that the State appears as the intermediary or reconciler between the opposing classes. On the contrary, it is only when the class antagonisms have become absolutely irreconcilable that the State arises, not as an arbitrator but as the instrument by which the successful class oppresses the defeated classes. The appearance of the state marks not the solution of the class antagonisms but their suppression by the ruthless victory of one of the combatants. The Mensheviks, Lenin tells us, are guilty of a gross heresy when they suppose that the state is the arbitrator between classes. It is, on the contrary, an instrument of legalized class despotism.<br><br>From these premises the rest of Lenin’s position follows logically enough. The state, thus generated, is obviously a disease of society. Its characteristics are prisons and a professional army and these indicate its repressive and despotic character. It is not any particular form of state which Lenin is condemning, but the State as such. Political democracy is to him on the same level with monarchy. They are both States, parasitic growths upon society, existing only in order that some dominant class may repress and exploit the proletariat. Hence Lenin drives home the sharp distinction between true Bolshevism and the extreme political democracy which seemed to some of us not unlike it. To strive for the amelioration of social conditions within the [34] state, to scatter universal suffrage and distribute doles—all this is useless in Lenin’s eyes. Engels indeed regards the universal suffrage of democratic countries as a specially clever instrument of Capitalist domination: and the Parliamentary system means only that the oppressed proletariat have, every few years, the opportunity of choosing which members of the ruling class will oppress them. The State itself must be overturned. Those who labour to reform the state instead of destroying it are traitors to the Proletariat and whether consciously or unconsciously are working for the continuation of despotism. The state is the mark of a diseased society, and the first step towards social health is to be rid of it.<br><br>Lenin’s next problem  naturally arises round the condition of society which is to follow the overthrow of the State. But his exposition is rendered rather confused by the fact that he feels obliged first to denounce some heresies which have been circulated by those he calls the Official Socialists. Engels, it appears, had remarked that the rise of the Proletariat would be followed by the withering away of the state. The Official Socialists have interpreted this to mean that with the advance of the Proletarian movement the State, now useless in a happier world, will gradually and peaceably fall into ruins and finally die a natural death. From this they have argued against the use of violence and pleaded that the advance may come not by revolution but by evolution. According to Lenin there could be no more disastrous misinterpretation of Engels’ real meaning. Engels, we are told, insists on the necessity of overthrowing the existing state by the application of violence. The Proletariat must first take possession with bomb and bayonet. It is only after this that the “withering away” process can begin. For Lenin maintains that the Proletariat, thus raised to power, cannot immediately dispense with political organization. The revolution will not immediately lead us to our goal of extinguishing the State. It is thus that Lenin finds himself in opposition to the Anarchists. The Anarchists wish to pass at one stride from the miseries of capitalist domination to the free society in which there is no law nor state whatsoever. Such a society, however, as Lenin points out, can only be realised when human nature has become different. But Lenin does not want to wait till then. The result of Anarchism is, in effect, to put off the revolution into the indefinite future: Lenin wants it at once: and if the revolution is to come at once we must still look forward to a new state existing after the revolution. It is this new state which is to “wither away” and finally conduct us to that millennium in which there shall be no state at all.<br><br>What, then, is to be the nature of the Proletarian state which will emerge from the revolution? Its nature is summed up for Lenin in the historic words “Dictatorship of the Proletariat.” Every state, as we saw, is the organ of despotism exercised by one class over another: the Proletarian state will therefore be a simple despotism exercised by the armed workers over the other classes. In this it will be little different from previous states: There will [35] be nothing but a change of masters. Lenin, nevertheless, labours to show that this state will be as unlike a state, as little political, as is compatible with its existence. The primitive element of the constitution will be the group of workers, the commune or Soviet, working through its elected officials. Every care will be taken, however, to keep these officials close to their electors and to prevent them from becoming an official class. They will receive ordinary workmens’ pay and they will be removable by the commune at a moment’s notice. There will be no bureaucracy. Capitalism has already so far simplified the business of the state that we need no mystery nor esoteric skill. The true image of the Proletarian officials is to be found in the clerks and sorters of the present day post office. The councils in which these humble officials meet will be very different from the Parliaments of the present day. As Lenin not unjustly observes, a Parliament tends to be a mere talking shop: the real business of government is carried on in secret by the heads of departments. The Proletarian council however will be its own executive: it will be a working committee. The distinction between legislative and executive power will disappear. The representatives of the commune, immediately removable by the commune will meet to discuss what is to be done and will do it themselves. There will be no division between them and the people.<br><br>Such is the new state, the Dictatorship of the Proletariat, which rises after the revolution, though only with the pious hope of “withering away.” It must not be confused with Democracy. The internal organization of the Proletariat into its Soviets may seem democratic: but the Proletariat as a whole will give no share of its liberty to other classes. As Engels remarks “The Proletariat needs the state not in the interests of liberty but for the purpose of crushing its opponents”: or, to quote Lenin’s own words, the communist state means “Democracy for the vast majority of the nation, and the suppression by force—that is, the exclusion from democracy—of the exploiters and oppressors.” Being in the majority the Proletariat will find it far easier to repress their late masters than the masters ever found it to oppress them. They will not need any such complex machinery as the Capitalists had naturally needed in their day. Indeed, as Lenin grimly remarks, all that is necessary can be affected by the “organization of the armed masses.”<br><br>Having made this distinction Lenin goes on to explain the Marxian doctrine of the phases through which the Proletarian state will pass in its process of withering away towards the final extinction of all stateship. The first and lowest phase will be a condition of what is ordinarily called socialism. Classes will have disappeared: the means of production will belong to the people as a whole: every one will work and every one will receive a share of the common goods in strict proportion to his work. This, however, says Lenin, is only “bourgeois justice”: necessary for a time, no doubt, but to be superseded. His argument, if I understand it aright, is like this. Men are naturally unequal: their work is unequal: a distribution of [36] wealth in proportion to work done will therefore be unequal and unjust. We must therefore look forward to a second or higher stage of Communism. In this phase the opposition between brain and manual work will have disappeared: labour will be no longer a means of supporting life but rather itself one of the necessities of life. At that level we shall transcend the imperfect bourgeois justice which gives to each man according to his services, and adopt instead the truly communistic formula “From each according to his ability: to each according to his need.”<br><br>Thus, at the end of 105 closely printed pages, the conjuror has brought the rabbit out of the hat. Here is the goal of the Bolshevist adventure, together with the steps by which the goal is to be reached. At this point I would willingly omit all reference to the abominations of Bolshevist practice which are perhaps no more relevant  here than the Romanoff abominations would be in a discussion on monarchy. Let us be content, for the moment, to study the Bolshevist theory. How far can the doctrines of Marx & Engels be regarded as a helpful addition to political thought? Do they offer us anything that is new or useful—anything calculated to show us the road of escape from the difficulties of our own time?<br><br>The fundamental assumption of the Marxian theory is, as we saw, that the State is a disease. Before the state was the non-political tribal society: after the state will be that society in which we ask from each according to his ability & give to each according to his needs. I do not quite understand how far the future period when the state has vanished is to be different (if at all) from the historical period before the state arose. Some general similarity Lenin appears glad to recognize. The absence of separate classes, the absence of specialisation, the wielding of force not by an army but by the whole armed mass of the tribe—these at any rate are points of resemblance. It is this which first gives me pause. We know something of these primitive societies in which classes and political organization has not yet arisen—some even in which a fairly complete communism is practised: but what we know does not inspire us to imitate them. Must civilised man sit at the feet of savages? It was excusable for the eighteenth century to indulge in dreams about the “noble savage”: it is not excusable for us who have modern anthropology at our command. We know too well the characteristics of primitive society,—the human sacrifices, the obscene and childish superstitions, the untroubled sensuality, the contented wallowing of the human animal in its native sty. Never again can we believe that by looking backward we shall find the forward road. To be sure, Lenin may reply that we are wrong in attributing to the free society of the future the grosser horrors of the pre-political savage society. Times have changed and it will be a man with centuries of civilisation behind him and modern science at his command who enters upon the final phase of communism. It is gratuitous to suppose that such a man, however non-political, will fall back into the primitive slough. And I think that such an answer [37] would be reasonable. But it leaves untouched my deepest objection to the whole theory. There still remains one point in which the society which Lenin anticipates will bear a fatal resemblance to primitive society. It will be one in which the collective will of the group or herd completely dominates over the individual. Lenin is quite explicit on this point. Instead of an army we shall have the force of the armed masses as a whole. Instead of the machinery of justice we shall have the immediate pressure of public disapproval. As Lenin says, justice will be done “by the armed nation itself as simply and as readily as any crowd of civilised people, even in modern society, parts a pair of combatants or does not allow a woman to be outraged.” I admit that there is a certain attraction about this ideal. But who does not see that it opens the way to a tyranny far harsher than that of any oriental despot? I waive the obvious objection that the genuine criminal works in secret and that we should therefore still need some machinery of detection. The thing goes far deeper. Our experience of savage societies, or of petty non political societies such as we find in public schools or army messes, shows us what this direct power of the herd really leads to. The savage is the least free of all men: every act of his life is hemmed round by rigid conventions: his marriages, his food, his dress, his language, his methods of eating or spitting, every trivial form of behaviour is dictated by immemorial custom: the least sign of variation is ruthlessly suppressed as “unclean “ or “unholy” or “unlucky.” In some of the West African tribes a woman who is guilty of the eccentricity of bearing twins is ostracised and the twins killed. In Thibet  it is unholy to eat with the left hand. In some societies one must wash only in running water: in others only in standing water. We see the same principle at work in the society of a school—the childhood of the individual being a true image of the childhood of the race. In a school, as in the African jungle, the herd dictates all and the individual must obey. The schoolboy can seldom choose whether he is to part his hair in the middle or at the side, whether he is to wear boots or shoes, whether he is to use certain slang expressions or certain others, whether he is to walk on the footpath or in the road. In both cases—the savage tribe and the boy-tribe—we have a working model of the pure non-political society in which the blind instincts of the human pack are allowed to have their way. I am not suggesting that these herd instincts always work badly: it is indeed a matter of pure chance how they work. They may enjoin what is really good and forbid what is really bad, and they may equally well do the opposite. But whatever they do, they do blindly. It is true, as Lenin supposes, that the crowd may interfere to part two combatants: but only if the whim takes it. It may equally well form a ring to watch them; or take sides till the whole tribe is in an uproar: or simply knock one of the combatants on the head if he happens to be unpopular—though his unpopularity may be based only on the colour of his socks or a cold manner of speech. The direct action of the herd is only another name for what used to be called mob-law, which is [38] the expression of the mob mind. But we know, as a matter of psychology, what the mob mind is. We know that [it] is generally more stupid, more cruel and more aimless than the mind of the worst individual in the mob. A crowd swayed by panic or by anger will behave worse than perhaps any one member of that crowd would have behaved alone. There is no mystery about this. The collective spirit of the herd is just the survival of the non-human element in man: the instinctive, animal basis showing through under his specifically human and rational variation. The transition from animal to man is the transition from blind collective herd action, to intelligent action by the individual. The history of man’s emergence from savagery is the history of the individual’s gradual release from the pressure of the herd. Through the individual comes all advance, all knowledge, wisdom, justice and nobility: through the herd comes the resistance, the drag. The martyr who is burned for his own private and reasoned convictions is the type of the individual: the mob that burns him, not understanding itself nor him,but conscious only of a blind impulse, is the type of the herd. I am not pretending, of course, that the herd spirit is in a perpetual state of panic or fury: on the contrary its rare moments of excitement only punctuate a steady level of stagnation. But when it is most quiet it is most insidious. Even now, while it is still in chains, we can see it at work in every club and every street. We can see it in the sway of fashion—the blind impulse which drives the herd to wear the same clothes and read the same books this year which they will throw aside next year: we can see it in the contempt and dislike of the crowd for all who do not conform: in the disinterested hatred of the average unregenerate human animal for all that he stigmatises as “highbrow” and knows by instinct to be out of reach: in the dogmatic athleticism of our schools: in the carping criticism and finger pointed at every man who walks his own way. We have all at times felt the fingers of the herd itching to be at us. The drunken subaltern who prefers fox trots to civilised music hates me at heart for not sharing his preference: my Irish friends are angry that I have acquired some English pronunciations. They would all like to make us conform. At best the herd spirit moves at the pace of the slowest members in the herd. By its nature it hates all that is pre-eminent. The brute in man recognizes its natural enemy in every individual who would possess his own soul in private and be free from the pressure of his fellows. It is said that if you tie a scarlet rag about a chicken’s foot the other chickens will peck it to death for being different: there is the essence of the herd spirit.<br><br>Here then lies the whole failure, for me, of Lenin’s theory. To reach the non-political society in which the herd shall be all in all is, in effect, to dehumanize man: to return him to the condition of the gregarious animals, to elevate the pack above the individual and dethrone reason in favour of instinct. The state, even at its worst, is the preferable alternative of the two: if, at least, it is better to be an unhappy man than a happy sheep. The state [39] always implies the dominance of the conscious reason of the individual over the mere instincts of the collective mass. It may be a dominance of one class over others guided by selfish cunning and cruelly exercised: but so long as the individual, not the collective instinct, is at the helm there will be some freedom and some hope for the future. In the herd-life there is no room for advance and no freedom, for the first signs of individual development will be ruthlessly repressed.<br><br>And if Lenin’s goal is thus undesirable the steps which he proposes to take towards that goal are even more so. What are we to say of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat, the revolutionary state which is to “wither away”? Firstly, that neither abstract probability nor the actual history of the Russian revolution encourages [us] to believe in the withering away process. Nor can we attach much importance to Lenin’s theory of the miraculous simplification which will reduce all officials in the Communist state to the level of post office clerks and dispense with developed bureaucracy. Such a theory is typical of the herd’s dislike of all that is pre-eminent. The average man has only an average intellect and he believes that all necessary work can be done by such an intellect. He believes that we have no need for talents which he does not possess and skill which he  cannot acquire. The result of applying this theory in practice has been to reduce a large empire to a condition of famine, without in reality keeping the officials any closer to the people than they are elsewhere. As to the despotism of the Proletariat over all other classes, it might at the first flush seem to be more just than the despotism of the Capitalists. If we must have a ruling class, why should it not be the largest class. In fact, however, the despotism of the Proletariat has proved less just, less intelligent and less merciful than any previous despotism and we can see why it must always do so. Where the few are masters and the many serve, the numbers on one side will always to some extent counterbalance and check the power on the other. A ruling class which is in the minority must observe some limits: even in absolute monarchy, as Dr. Johnson observed, if the king is too oppressive the people will rise up and cut his head off. When the positions are re-versed, when the many are masters, this check is removed. The Proletarian despotism has nothing to fear: it is the only perfect tyranny. Yet again, when the few rule, they rule by merit of some sort: some pre-eminence, though it were only of cunning or physical strength, they must have to enable to lead the many headed beast in harness. But the many, in the nature of things, have no claim but their numbers: they represent merely the dead level—the average human mudflat. What hope is there that they whose very claim is that they have no outstanding power of brain nor goodness of heart, should learn to rule justly or even to guard their own interests. Mixed with other elements in a democratic constitution they may have their use: erected into a privileged class it is impossible that they should bring forth other fruits than those of misery and confusion. I am not, [40] of course, defending existing conditions: justice and prudence may demand a drastic alteration in social life. But no alteration that leads to the Dictatorship of the Proletariat can lead to happiness. A despotism exercised without restraint by those who owe their power to  no single desirable quality of mind or spirit and whose very Shibboleth is to be undistinguished must by its nature be too stupid to rule, too selfish to abdicate and too weak to resist external aggression.",

        textProvided: "Zeus, in the graver pictures of him, sits immovably on some cold mountain top far beyond the region of clouds and storms. He “neither slumbers nor sleeps” and his nod shakes all Olympus. Such a god, from the first, invites metaphysical treatment. We know that the people who talked thus of Zeus will sooner or later talk of the One, and the Form of the Good which is beyond existence. In his lighter vein—the vein of the Διὸς ἀπάτη—he represents the animalism made perfect, the eternal irresponsibility, in which tired moderns sometimes find the most attractive side of Paganism.  The first Zeus is above the human struggle, the second, simply outside it. Neither of them has anything to do with time. But Odin is a spirit rooted in time. He waits for the twilight of the gods. He has no true immortality, only longevity: no one ever thought of him as young. This seriousness of mortality raises him above the frivolous Zeus, while the mortal limitation depresses him below the Zeus of Phidias.  And being in time, he is also in the struggle. He has descended into Hel, been tortured between two fires, hung on the tree Ygdrasil, starved, grown grey, and lost an eye. If we look for his parallel in the Greek stories we shall find it not in the “easily living” gods but rather in the resourceful, stubborn, hard-bitten Ulysses. But even Ulysses reached home in the end, while Odin expects no final victory. He is the type of the man “up agin’ it”. His mythus, as told in the Eddas, is one long illustration of the principle that finds expression in the lines<br><br>Hyge sceal þe heardra, heorte þe re Genre,<br>Mod þe mare, pe ure maegen Lytlað. <br><br>þiudric > þeodric<br><br>To invent is one thing: to know that we are inventing is another, and it will be convenient to keep the name of Fiction for this second thing, the conscious invention. One sometimes hears a couple of children speculating as to what happened “afterwards” to the characters in a story they have heard, or what the cat does when she goes away  at nights. Each detail, as it first appears, wears the likeness of a hypothesis: it may be introduced by such words as “perhaps” or “I expect.” But the earlier hypotheses, without being tested, are simply assumed as background for the later: the whole that results is an invention. Yet the same children, if they are not exceptional or precocious, might become dumb, or lose half their virtue, if they were told to cease guessing and “make up” a story instead. Such, or something like it, may be the process by which the stories of Atli and Gunther  were first conjured out of their historical germ.

        textProvided: "You say that when I describe Vidler’s method as that of “scrapping inconvenient data” I am assuming from the outset a position he does not grant. I am assuming that Scripture supplies the data for theology—the “hard facts” with which all theories must square—just as sense experience (aided by instruments and forced by experiments to be unequivocal) supplies the data for the physical sciences. But this, you say, implies a view of Scripture which most theologians have ceased to hold. You believe that, if pressed, it will turn out to involve inerrancy, and miraculous purity of the text, and literal interpretation of the text; in a word, Fundamentalism. And so we shall be back at “proof-texts” and “text-hunting” and all the rest of it. And do I really want that?<br><br>Well, no, I don’t. One of my reasons for disbelieving in literal inspiration is that this theory is contradicted by Scripture itself. The opening sentence of St. Luke tells us explicitly that he got his facts by inquiry, in a purely human and natural fashion. And I disbelieve in the inerrancy of Scripture because there are contradictions in the historic parts. What is more important, the Bible contains compositions which don’t even offer themselves as records of fact. Anyone who is a critic at all—I don’t mean a “Higher Critic”, but a real critic, a man with some feeling for literature—sees at once that Jonah or Esther is not even trying to be the same kind of thing as the accounts of David’s court, or Acts. Job is the clearest example. He has no genealogy. He lives in a country we know nothing about, at a wholly undefined period. He has no existence apart from the main story, drags with him into light none of those <i>uninteresting</i> details which always accompany a historical person. “Once upon a time” is writ large over the whole book.<br><br>So far I go with the Modernists—but indeed also with St. Jerome and Calvin—and against the Fundamentalists. But I differ from the former in three ways.<br><br>Firstly, I have no <i>a priori</i> disbelief in the miraculous and have never yet heard any argument which convinced me that I should. A modernist would think a passage unhistorical because it contained a miracle: I would gauge the probable or improbable historicity of the miracle by the general character of the narrative in which it occurred. Thus Job is for me unhistorical for the reasons I’ve just given; not because it ends with a theophany.<br><br>The second difference is really a generalised form of the first. I do not bring to the reading of the Bible—nor, for that matter, of Homer, Aeschylus, Aristotle, or <i>Beowulf</i>—the assumption that our modern “outlook on life” is simply right and that the only valuable elements in any ancient book are those which win our immediate sympathy. I go to the past to broaden my mind, not to confirm my homebred opinions. I think every age has its blind spots and its special insights, and the present is merely a period like any other. In every age the Father of Lights and the Father of Lies are both at work. This perhaps explains my view of the miraculous. I know as well as you that ancient men easily thought they had seen it where it was not; I think it equally probable that we should fail to see if it were present. The “real world” for every age is in a large measure something selectively built out of the chaos of raw experience.<br><br>Thirdly and with all respect for the men themselves, I am profoundly sceptical about what they call Higher Criticism. I learned my scepticism from the reviews of my own books and books by my friends. You will laugh, but wait a moment. The author of a book is certainly the worst judge of any praise or censure it receives. But you would hardly believe how often only a small part of a review is taken up with either one or the other. Most of it may be engaged in trying to do to your book what the Higher Critics try to do to the books of the Bible; that is, to write a history of its composition —when, with what intentions, how, under what influences, with what resources, you wrote it. Now of this, the author is not only the best but the final judge. What the critics guess at, he knows; can’t help knowing. And can you guess how often I have found such imaginary histories of my own books correct? I believe I could conscientiously say, Never. I am sure I can say, Seldom. Friendly, hostile, moderate reviewers can be equally wrong.<br><br>Yet consider how easy their work was compared with that of the Higher Critic. They were dealing with a contemporary; a man who wrote and thought in their own language; educated as they were, exposed to all the same influences; perhaps personally known to them. A man of their own trade (for reviewers are usually authors). The Higher Critic has none of these advantages. In addition, he has often become a higher Critic without troubling just to become a critic, without acquiring a good nose for the differences between myth, legend, fiction, history, and reportage. He may also be a man who has never written, and never attempted to write, anything like the books he is discussing.<br><br>These considerations have been of immense use to me in my own studies. Let no one trouble me again with a new story of how <i>Piers Plowman</i> or <i>The Faerie Queene</i> was written. All labour lost. I cannot help also concluding that what the Higher Critic claims to know about the composition of certain sacred texts cannot really be discovered. Most of their work, I fancy, will presently rank with the other strange dreams men have had about the Bible; with the medieval allegorisations or the Puritan attempt to find in it a pattern of church government.<br><br>From all this, I suppose you may conclude that I attach to the Bible a kind and degree of value which would not satisfy the Fundamentalist and would go a good deal too far for Vidler. Like him, I believe in the guidance of the Holy Spirit. But I could not, like him, trust that guidance for the future if I thought that nearly everything which had seemed to come from it in the past was now found to be erroneous, so that the whole intertwined history of Bible, Church, and individual religious experience can be set aside wherever we meet a difficulty. What would such a view imply? That we, being holier and wiser and more abundant in sufferings than the prophets, apostles, martyrs, and doctors of the past, were more receptive? Or that the Holy Spirit had now learned better how to guide us?<br><br>I don’t, do I, need to say that Scripture is <i>the</i> datum? But surely, at least one of the data? Let the tradition of the Church, and the agreement between dissentient churches, the experiences of great saints, the teachings of great doctors, be  all the data. It is someone’s job, perhaps, to sort them out into a strict order of precedence. I don’t think it is mine. I am content to say that the more of these data any theology can reconcile, the stronger it will be. In every other discipline, after all, reckless jettison is a sign of weakness. In dealing with a crux from Sophocles or Shakespeare the worst critic is he who just throws up the sponge by saying, “This is corrupt”. There are corruptions; not so many as a bad scholar thinks. There are illusions; but do not be too easily convinced that every reported appearance which makes against your own theory is one of them.<br><br>You remember, long ago, <i>Punch’s</i> definition of an optimist: “a man who thinks that all the words he doesn’t know are misprints.”",

        textProvided: "[The first quarto, Q1, is, as Lewis notes here, a highly problematic text; Dowden gives some excerpts from its unique readings in an appendix, and Lewis notes on one occasion (Ophelia’s description of the mad Hamlet, II.i.87) that he]<br><br>cannot help regretting<br><br>[their loss from the received text. The last back endpaper contains three tightly packed columns of]<br><br>Hermeneutica<br><br>[(Lewis’s heading), that is, words or phrases of particular interest or obscurity, which spill over into two more columns in the bottom half of the inside back cover—some 250 in all (Fig 1) {Page 94, which contains Fig 1, the holograph of the ‘Hermeneutica’ page, is largely illegible.} {95} A better indication of when {Lewis} might have made {these annotations} is that a number refer to the views of]<br><br>D.W.<br><br>[sometimes as a supplement to Dowden’s own notes, sometimes in order to disagree. D.W. is John Dover Wilson, editor of the Cambridge Shakespeare series, whose edition of Hamlet was published in 1934. Some of these seem to have been added as a later layer to Lewis’s original annotations, as the numbers in the text linking them to the notes are occasionally out of order, the number]<br><br>2<br><br>[on a page of text preceding a]<br><br>1<br><br>[but there is no difference in the handwriting, and it looks as if they all belong to much the same period of his life. {...} A date close to the appearance of Dover Wilson’s edition is confirmed by his note on Gertrude’s notorious comment on her son in the duel with Laertes, ‘He’s fat, and scant of breath’ (V.ii.298; ‘fat’ underlined in the text). Lewis annotates ‘fat’ as]<br><br>Sweaty…A pupil tells me (1935) that he has heard <u>fat</u> for ‘sweaty’ in Wales.<br><br>[{96} When Hamlet describes a king’s relationship with his flatterers as ‘He keeps them, like an ape, in the corner of his jaw’ (IV.ii.19-20, the Folio reading adopted by Dowden), Lewis lines up the variant readings listed in Dowden’s textual notes for ‘like an ape’)—]<br><br>Q1 <u>as an Ape doth nuttes</u>; Q2 <u>like an apple</u>; F1 <u>like an Ape</u><br><br>[and notes]<br><br>All three make good sense: I see no way of deciding that one is more genuine than another.<br><br>[On the ‘slings’ of ‘slings and arrows of outrageous fortune’ (III.i.58), he notes that in Michael Drayton’s poem on the battle of Agincourt, ‘slings’ may]<br><br>apparently…mean ‘culverins,’ tho’ there is no proof that it here does<br><br>[He draws a linguistic family tree to show how the different meanings of]<br><br>circumstance<br><br>[might have developed. He will also on occasion try out what Shakespeare’s original copy might have looked like. When Claudius worries that ‘The terms of our estate may not endure / Hazard so near us as doth hourly grow / Out of his lunacies,’ (III.iii.5-7), the word ‘lunacies’ is taken from the Folio text, where the quarto editions have ‘browes’. Lewis settles for a third reading, ‘lunes’, meaning]<br><br>fits of lunacy<br><br>[he comments,]<br><br>Q must be a misreading of <u>lunes</u><br><br>[followed by a writing of both words in an imitation of the secretary hand standard around 1600, to show how similar they might look]<br><br>and F a compositor’s, or editor’s, substitution of the more familiar for the less. Read <u>lunes</u>. D.W. conj <u>brawls</u>.<br><br>[{97} In his discussion of the problem of ‘O that this too too solid flesh would melt’—the Folio reading of I.ii.129, where the quarto reading is ‘sallied’ and more recent editors have suggested ‘sullied’—Lewis comments,]<br><br>The emendation sulled for sallied of course involves no paleographical difficulties: but the F. reading is excellent. I cannot agree with D.W. that “there is something absurd in associating ‘solid flesh’ with ‘melt’.” Nay, what wd. melt if not a solid?<br><br>[A trivial substitution of Dover Wilson’s later in the play (‘and’ for the Folio’s ‘yea’ at III.iv.49) elicits a still sharper comment, that the alteration is]<br><br>needlessly the very exstasy [sic] of paleography!<br><br>[In lines spoken over Claudius as he is attempting to pray, Hamlet expresses the wish that the king’s ‘heels may kick at heaven’ as his soul tumbles into hell (III.iii.93-5). Samuel Johnson, one of the great Shakespeare scholars, had complained that the lines are ‘too horrible to be read’, a judgement rejected by Dover Wilson on the grounds that ‘they are no more “barbarous” than Hamlet’s “fattning the region kites” or Laertes’ “cut his throat in the Church”’—all of which Lewis quotes, concluding with]<br><br>surely an odd view!<br><br>[...another occurs with the line ‘What a piece of work is a man’ (II.ii.318), where one late quarto reads simply ‘is man’, a reading also argued for, as Dowden and Lewis note, by two of the play’s nineteenth-century editors. Lewis’s comment runs:]<br><br>But it would need better evidence to make me alter F1 so greatly for the worse. <u>Man</u> is a Godwin and Shelley figment: <u>a man</u> is the concrete (I owe this to Barfield)<br><br>[He is emphatic on the fact that Hamlet, in accordance with the early modern belief as set {98} out in the 1572 work <i>Of Ghosts and Spirits walking by Night</i> (itself cited, he notes, by Dover Wilson), does not assume that the ghost is his father’s: an apparent spirit of the dead might well be a devil in disguise, and Hamlet needs a proof that it is not.]<br><br>Of course all the characters, v. properly, wobble.<br><br>[On Hamlet’s comment to Polonius on the players, that everyone would deserve whipping (II.ii.564-5), he notes that the lines have]<br><br>more point if we remember that that [sic] Players were classed by the Act of 1572 with rogues and vagabonds to “bee grevouslye whipped”<br><br>[unless they had aristocratic patronage. For the gravediggers’ discussion of suicide, he writes]<br><br>Excellent<br><br>[beside Dowden’s note citing a contemporary account of an analogous coroner’s case. {...} He joins the debate about whether the inset play speech ‘The rugged Pyrrhus’ (II.ii.483) is intended to be recognized as an imitation of Marlowe or as a parody, and insists that it is certainly not]<br><br>intended to be ridiculous<br><br>[in support, he quotes Coleridge’s description of it as]<br><br>‘this admirable substitution of the epic for the dramatic’<br><br>[It is the character of Hamlet himself, however, that had been the focus of criticism from the eighteenth century forward, and it is that that forms the sole topic of the four pages of notes at the start of Lewis’s copy. Here he summarises or quotes the views of 26 earlier critics {...} These concentrate largely on two issues: why does Hamlet not kill Claudius right away, and does he really go mad? The latter elicits the briefest of the cited quotations, Voltaire’s]<br><br>‘H. becomes crazy in the second act.’<br>[Lewis then summarizes these in the final half-page of the four, headed]<br><br>Equidem<br><br>[{Latin for} ‘for my part’. Here, he divides the differing views of his 26 critics into four groups, each with the relevant names attached:]<br><br>I The ‘Pressure of Grief’ group<br>II The ‘Shakespeare bungling’ group<br>III The ‘Madness’ group<br>IV The ‘Hamlet awaiting Proofs’ group<br><br>[{99} to which he adds]<br><br>what may be called the orthodox tradition which attributes the delay to the weakness of Hamlet. [...] My own view wd. be orthodox with some modifications. <u>Hamlet</u> is the tragedy of weakness. But group I are right in attributing the weakness to Hamlet’s three intolerable experiences rather than to an original character—that is, a character before the play began, of which we can know nothing. The weakness springs from disgust, from the haunting, from apparently despised love, and from fear of death [with page references in parentheses to the soliloquies ‘To be or not to be’ and ‘How all occasions’, and the exchange with Horatio culminating in ‘What is’t to leave betimes?’]. But this weakness is finally overcome. H’s mind is made up when he is summoned to the duel: not that he foresaw what would there occur, but that he was now ready to take the next opportunity [with a page reference in parentheses to that same exchange with Horatio]. And finally, the weakness is not to be regarded as anything abnormal, nor is all the delay to be laid to its charge—the journey to England being compulsory. The inner history of any great action performed by a man of the reflective (as opposed to the heroic) type, wd be found to contain all these turnings and windings: and the soliloquies ‘Oh what a rogue’ and ‘How all occasions’ owe their endless appeal to the fact that we have all said them already—to ourselves. <u>Hamlet</u> (as Hazlitt said of his creator) ‘is just like any other man, except that he is every other man’. In him, Sh., by extreme individualising, reaches the universal. See how Goethe and Coleridge (why shd. I venture into their company!) and poor Hazlitt all betray themselves as soon as they describe him.<br><br>[{101} In “Hamlet: The Prince or the Poem?” Lewis quotes the extract from Shaftesbury that he had copied into his Arden edition, that this play above all others seems]<br><br>‘most to have affected English hearts and has perhaps been oftenest acted’",

        textProvided: "[What follows are the texts of the four major paragraphs in the manuscripts as printed by Johnston that were omitted in <i>Broadcast Talks.</i> The first two of these were also printed in Walter Hooper’s <i>Companion and Guide.</i>]<br><br>[<i>Companion & Guide</i> 306-307 = Johnston 350-351; cut from <i>Broadcast Talks,</i> Part II, chapter I, 37. The cut paragraph would have been the first paragraph. Hooper also includes, or inserts, an extra word, given below in {braces}.]<br><br>It’s not because I’m anybody in particular that I’ve been asked to tell you what Christians believe. In fact, it’s just the opposite. They’ve asked me, first of all because I’m a layman and not a parson, and consequently it was thought I might understand the ordinary person’s point of view a bit better. Secondly, I think they asked me because it was known that I’d been an atheist for many years and only became a Christian quite fairly recently. They thought that would mean I’d be able to see the difficulties—able to remember what Christianity looks like from the outside. So you see, the long and short of it is that I’ve been selected for this job just because I’m an amateur not a professional, and a beginner, not an old hand. Of course, this means that you may well ask what right I have to talk on the subject at all. Well, when I’d finished the scripts, I sent them round to various people who <u>were</u> professionals: to one Church of England theologian, one Roman Catholic, one Presbyterian, and one Methodist. The Church of England man and the Presbyterian agreed with the whole thing. The Roman Catholic and the Methodist agreed in the main, but would have liked one or two places altered. So there you’ve got all the cards on the table. What I’m going to say isn’t <u>exactly</u> what all these people would say; but the greater part of it is what all Christians agree on. And the main reason why I couldn’t alter it so as to make them agree completely was that I’ve only got 15 minutes for each talk. That doesn’t give you time to make many subtle distinctions. You’ve got to go at it rather like a bull in a china shop or you won’t get through. One thing I can promise you. In spite of all {the} unfortunate differences between Christians, what they agree on is still something pretty big and pretty solid; big enough to blow any of us sky-high if it happens to be true. And if it’s true, it’s quite ridiculous to put off doing anything about it simply because Christians don’t fully agree among themselves. That’s as if a man bleeding to death refused medical assistance because he’d heard that some doctors differed about the treatment of cancer. For if Christianity is true at all, it’s as serious as that. Well, here goes.<br><br>[<i>Companion & Guide</i> 308 = Johnston 361; cut from <i>Broadcast Talks,</i> Part II, chapter III, 51. The cut paragraph would have come midway through the final paragraph, right after “...or the Devil of Hell.”]<br><br>Of course you can take the line of saying He didn’t say these things, but His followers invented them. But that’s only shifting the difficulty. They were Jews too: the last people who would invent such a thing, the people who had never said anything of the sort about Moses or Elijah. That theory only saddles you with twelve inexplicable lunatics instead of one. We can’t get out of it that way. <br><br>[Johnston 344, cut from <i>Broadcast Talks,</i> Part I, chapter IV, 23. The cut paragraph was replaced by the first sentence of the chapter as printed.]<br><br>I must begin by apologizing for my voice. Since we last met I’ve managed to catch an absolute snorter of a cold. So if you hear this talk wildly interrupted tonight by a loud crash you needn’t jump to any rash conclusions. It’ll be probably only be me sneezing or coughing. Well the point I got to last week was this.<br><br>[Johnston 359, cut from <i>Broadcast Talks,</i> Part II, chapter III, 47. This passage would have come in the third paragraph, after the sentence ending “...hardly be worth creating.”]<br><br>Some people don’t see this because they haven’t tried to imagine a world without free will. Just imagine someone you’re fond of–your wife or your daughter–meeting you, and being nice to you, and then imagine that you knew all the time that every look, and word, and laugh was just as much out of her control as the weather–that she couldn’t possibly do otherwise–that it all <u>meant</u> nothing. Imagine a world in which a man who jumped in to save your life when you were drowning was no more to be thanked than a man who had accidentally fallen in after you, because neither of them had the slightest choice in the matter! Imagine a world in which it made no difference whether you knew what your son had been doing today because he told you the truth or because you’d set a private detective to watch him–since in either case his will would have had nothing to do with it. A world in which you couldn’t even feel pleased when you’d made a good stroke at golf because your efforts had had nothing to do with it and you were <u>bound</u> to hit the ball right. In fact that’s a good example. In the real world we distinguish good strokes from flukes. In a world without freedom, everything would be a fluke. Don’t you see it would be a nightmare? A world without love, without thanks, without friends, even without amusements. I think after a week of that world you’d be very glad to get back to the real one, with all its wars and wickedness and suffering. At any rate there’s no doubt which world God has chosen to make.",

I have done so in order to repay a great debt. If I seem to you in the whole to be talking of things of a very ancient history, you must forgive me. I am trying through you to thank your ancestors.<br><br>My imaginative life almost begins with an awakening to Norse mythology which came when I was about fourteen. [247] When I came to my conception of it, it was then romantic and in many ways erroneous, depending on a period of translation by our English books which could hardly be otherwise. But when years later I began at Oxford to learn your language, I found nothing in my earlier love that had to be thrown away. That language still seems to be one of the sharpest and strongest of humankind, one of the best adapted for carrying out the ideal of the old poets:<br><br>Let your words at the feast be strewn [?],<br>but let them cut like a sword.<br>Let — — still listen to it,<br>and still touch my heart as perhaps no other can.<br><br>This experiment in rhyme is not so uncommon among Englishmen as you might suppose. In every generation since the beginning of the eighteenth century, there have been some who felt a kind of compass needle in them pointing to the North–the essayist and dramatist Sir William Temple, the poet Grey, William Morris. What is the explanation? I do not think it — to point out or kinship by blood and our early connections. All that, of course, is true. We too are a Baltic people. Our first great poem, Beowulf, celebrates Danish heroes. We had Norsemen as kings, but blood explains little. I myself am of Welsh descent, and if blood were all, I ought to find my natural food in — —, but in fact, the — is as insipid to me as the other is intoxicating.<br><br>If the northern enchantment caught so many Englishmen, it is because of a real, though subtle, affinity of temper between the two which then informs in addition to blood kinship, —. The affinity is easy to feel but difficult to define. One starting point is the fact, recognized I think by all scholars, that whenever a medieval Englishman translated a French romance, he made it a little less courtly; he brought it a little nearer to earth. The farmyard and the castle are nearer to the English person than to the original. And this compliment runs [248] all through our literature straight down — —, but they are really very earthy people, the vulgar counterpart, England sets on — romance. — — all be heroes — —, but the — — people lies in their peasant — and common —. Whenever — — <br><br>[Side 2 is missing]<br><br>[Side 3]<br><br>But heaven forbid I should mention Dickens only to speak ill of him. His very name recalls me at once to what is perhaps the strongest of all affinities between these two antic [antique?] islands. To speak of Dickens is to think of Bumble the beadle, and that carries our mind at once to a whole crowd of thick-headed magistrates, interfering philanthropists, tyrannical administrators of the Poor Law, and the like. Have you ever noticed the fact that Dickens, in Shakespeare, in Fielding, in the whole range of English literature, a person in petty authority, a minor official hardly ever appears except to be made ridiculous? There seems to be a deep conviction in our minds that the man who carries some wand of office is more likely than other men to be half knave and wholly fool.<br><br>I need not remind you of the similar spirit in Old Icelandic. The very origins of Iceland lie in the impeccable independence of those who went there from Norway because they would not be dragooned at home, would not be brought up to bent and made into a tiny little medieval monarchy on the pattern of the other European countries. I would not like to be hasty in giving this spirit a name. It is not democracy, for it dislikes interfering officialdom in a democratic form of government, at least as much as under any other. It is not in essence the revolutionary spirit. Revolution, in the sense of innovation, is not what it seeks. It generally demands to be left alone and shuts its front door in your face. It is not exactly individualism, for it is quite compatible with the most self-effacing loyalty to a family, a patch of ground, or a chief. But it likes to choose its [249] own chief and to choose him for what he really is: his wisdom, his courage, his beauty, or the fact that he is an old friend. I think it is a little — to admit the claims of high descent than to admit those of official status, because they seem a little more intrinsic to the man. It does not assert the rights of man in the abstract, but the rights of a particular man. In the long run, it can be described as personal realism. It brings every situation between two people back to what those two people really are. If Bumble or Harald Fairhair wants to be treated as the better man, he must show he is the better man. Its favorite formula in our language is, “and who the devil are you, anyway?”<br><br>[Side 4 is missing]",

        textProvided: "Sometimes one can explain a real thing only by first describing something imaginary, and that is what I am now going to do. I hope you will have patience if I seem to be taking a long time. For the matter is important. To understand about the Praise or Adoration of God is more important than any of the things you were going to ask God to give you, more important, in a sense, than your own Salvation. At least “Salvation,” if you could have it without this, would be no good to you . . . Picture a vast open space where creatures of all sorts, including Man but some of them far higher, stronger, more ancient and godlike than he, stand in a circle; waiting. Though the assembly is so great (millions upon millions) there is perfect silence, for they are all expecting something. At last, suddenly, it is there in the midst. I cannot, even by imagination, suggest what it appears like to the nonhuman spectators; except that it is their heart’s desire. And I can suggest only very dimly how it appears to the men and women and children. It is in one way like a physical sensation: like fresh air with garden smells in it after you have been long shut up in a stuffy room; like the ease that comes when you take off an uncomfortable pair of shoes; like cool water rippling round hot feet or warm water embracing cold ones; like the blessed emptiness in the place where a sharp pain was, now that the pain has gone. In a word it is like relief, like everything which would make you say “It’s alright <i>now</i>.” In another way, however, it is more like a kind of knowledge than a kind of sensation: like the moment when you first see, in one glorious flash, the answer to a problem you have been working on for years, and see, almost in the same flash, how this is going to be the answer to a whole series of other problems (which you thought quite unconnected) and how perfectly it fits in with everything else you know. And you wonder how you could have been so dense as not to see it before. Now at last you can really get on . . . Once again you will say “It’s alright <i>now</i>. I see <i>Now</i>.” All your thinking, up till that moment, will appear to have been fumbling and groping and misapprehension. Now the real clue has been put into your hand. You can go on and on now; no more deadends, no more false trails: you have a master-secret and it is going to lead to—well, literally, to everything. But then, in yet another way, this thing that has appeared is more like beauty than it is like knowledge. All that ever led you on mile after mile among the mountains, all that rushes back on your mind at the smell of the sea, all that you ever felt during those few perfect moments (and they are very few) when great music or great verse was having its completest effect upon you, so that you ceased to be aware of yourself at all, all that, and more, comes full upon those who see this thing. All, and more: it is obvious now that all the other beauties were only shreds and echoes and copies of this. This is where they all came from; this is the real thing at last. If you were allowed to enjoy it for a thousand years you would not notice the passage of time. And yet again, this thing is like love. It is like coming home to the faces and voices and the very smells and sounds you love best, after long, lonely years in some cruel country, perhaps in a prison camp. It is like meeting again your best beloved, whom you thought to be dead, or with whom you had quarreled, and finding that all is well. You see now why I cannot describe it. For though, in one sense, it is most certainly like all the things I have suggested, yet after all it is utterly unlike them. All these remind you of it; yet when it appears it is overwhelmingly new. It gives you experiences so new that it has to give you new modes of sensation to receive them. It opens a new world, outside and beyond all that you have known. It satisfies desires which you never knew you had. If I could really describe it, my words would break like the heart of everyone who read them. But of course it is impossible for any man to describe it . . . But try to accept (only as an imagination) the idea that its coming fills all that assembly of creatures with utter satisfaction of all their known, and unknown, desires; that when they see it they become themselves for the first time, and know beyond doubt that this is the thing they were made for.<br><br>You will not find it hard to suppose that when it appeared some sound would break from the lips of all those creatures: perhaps just a long inarticulate <i>Oh</i>.<br><br>Now that sound, the delight of the creatures made audible, may stand as our first crude idea of Praise. For the Christian doctrine is that at the back of everything, in the heart of everything, there is a Being of absolute beauty, the heart’s desire of all the creatures He has made. And we have been made in order that we might thus meet Him. And the inevitable result of that meeting, on our part, is that we should praise or adore.<br><br>[Lewis will go on to say that, if we couldn’t praise God when we encounter him in heaven, it would actually bother us, it would]<br><br>be a kind of stifling and torture",

For instance, a section titled]<br><br>First steps in OE<br><br>[sets out the elements of the Old English spelling and pronunciation. This is followed by a series of instructions which are clearly intended to form homework for his students:]<br><br>Read a passage. Learn hē, se, þes<br><br>[that is, the declension of the third person singular masculine pronoun and the demonstrative pronouns se and þes, equivalent to Modern English ‘the/that’ and ‘this’. This is followed by the instruction to learn]<br><br>hām<br><br>[the noun ‘home’, which declines according to the masculine strong noun declension. This is followed by an account of the first sound law (known today as First Fronting), and listings of the various classes of strong verb, set out with their principal parts from which the full conjugations can be derived. Students are then expected to define a long syllable, learn how to decline the long and short-stemmed neuter nouns <i>land</i> and <i>scip</i>, as well as the noun <i>fæt</i>, and how to explain its variant forms. This is followed by an account of Verner’s Law, and an explanation of how it helps to make sense of the anomalies found in various strong verb forms, e.g. the presence of an <r> in the preterite plural and past participle forms of cēosan: – cēas – curon – coren. It is clear that Lewis’s students were expected to make quick progress from the basics to more advanced topics. Lewis’s notes were intended to function as a kind of gloss on E.E. Wardale’s <i>An Old English Grammar</i>, first published in 1922, in an attempt to make her {130} explanations simpler than he himself had found them. Alongside his description of how fracture (a process of diphthongization of vowels before certain consonant clusters known today as ‘breaking’) affected strong verbs, Lewis has noted:]<br><br>Am substituting a simpler explanation of W’s p. 106 n.1<br><br>[The corresponding note in Wardale’s grammar explains that: ‘þēon belonged originally to the third class and had a form *þinhan. Traces of this appear in a pret. plur. indicative oferþungon, pret. subjunctive þunge, and past part. geþungen (used as an adjective) and oferþungen’. (p. 106).]",

The hurlers of the spear lay sleeping, even they that were appointed to guard the gabled house, all save one. For now it was made manifest to men that their demon foe had no power, when the Lord would not, to snatch them down into the realm of darkness. Beowulf slept not: full of wrath against the fierce enemy, he abode in anger the issue of their battle. Then from the mountain, among the fells where the mist tarries, came Grendel stalking, and bore the burden of God’s anger. The evil-doer was minded in that lofty hall to ensnare many a child of man. Under the clouds he went to where he well knew that he might find the golden house, even the place, gleaming with sheeted gold, where heroes drank their wine. It was not the first journey he had made to Hrothgar’s home; but never in the days of his life, before nor after, gat he a harder lot nor harder thanes in the hall. The spirit of war came now in his journey even unto the hall, the spirit that knew no joy. Full soon the door, for all its bands of forged iron, sprang open when Grendel’s hand was laid upon it. Evil was his mind, hot his fury, as he rent asunder the mouth of the hall. And swiftly after that the enemy walked the bright-paved floor, came on with rage in his heart. Out of his eyes there streamed unlovely light, and its likeness was as fire. There he beheld many warriors sleeping in the hall, the whole fellowship of kinsmen assembled, and the multitude of men of war. His heart laughed within him. The terrible one, the warrior, was minded ere day came to sunder the life from the body of every one of them, now that such hope of banquet had befallen him.<br><br>[131-132, covering lines 1251-1278, the fight with Grendel’s mother:]<br><br>Then they laid them down to sleep; one paid a generous price for his evening’s bed, as it had full often befallen them since Grendel haunted the golden hall and dealt unrighteously till his end gat hold of him, even death according to his sins. Now it was made manifest and widely known among men that there lived yet an avenger after the slaying of their foe, a long time after the trouble of their warfare. The woman, the she-terror, remembered affliction: even Grendel’s mother {131} whose habitation was appointed among perilous waters and cold streams ever since Cain arose to slay with the edge of the sword his only brother, his father’s seed. Then he departed with the stain of blood upon him, marked with murder to flee from men and their delights. The wilderness was his dwelling. Of him there sprang many spirits of the elder creation. Grendel was one of them, wolf’s head of war, the spirit of hatred; but in Heorot he found a man that slept not, but abode the battle. There the terrible one wrestled with him. Howbeit he remembered the strength of his might, and the manifold gift that God had given him. He put his trust in the mercy of the Almighty, even in His comfort and succour: thereby he overcame the enemy, he laid low the spirit of Hell. And Grendel was humbled and went his ways: the spirit that knew no joy, the enemy of the children of men, went to look upon the abode of death. And now, after all that, his mother was an-hungered and her heart was sore: she was minded to make a journey full of care, to avenge the death of her son.<br><br>[Lewis’s concern with finding a translation that he is happy with is apparent from his inclusion of an alternative rendering of line 1251:]<br><br>They got down to it; but one man paid a high price for that evening’s rest as had happened to them very often since Grendel became sentry of the goldhall<br><br>[133-134, covering lines 1529-1556, the fight with Grendel’s mother continued:]<br><br>Then yet again the kinsman of Higelac was constant: he was no laggard in his might, neither forgat he his noble deeds. The man of war in his wrath cast away the patterned blade, even the sword wreathed with cunning works. It lay on the earth, the hard sword steely-edged. Now all his trust was in main strength and the mighty grip of his hands. Even so it behoves a man to do when he is minded to gain in battle long-lasting praise, and cares not for his life. The warrior Geat gat hold on Grendel’s dam by her shoulder: the quarrel dismayed him not at all. When his anger was kindled, he that was hardy in war dragged his mortal enemy till she stooped to the ground. But soon with her horrible grip she repaid him. She came with he[r] grasp against him: the dark-souled horror threw him down; she made him fall, strongest of warriors though he were, of men that fight upon  their feet. She sate upon that stranger in her hall: she drew her knife, broad and bright of edge; minded to avenge her son, her only child. The woven net of mail lay on his breast and shoulders, and warded his life, withstood the entry of point or edge. In that hour the son of Ecgtheow, the warrior of the Geats, would have gone his way under the great deep unless his corselet of battle, even the hard net of war, had given him help, and holy God appointed him victory. Easily did the wise Lord, the ruler of the heavens, dispense a righteous doom, when Beowulf rose again to his feet.",

If the enclosed notes help at all, use them as you see fit. I like your Contact Club and wish it all the best.<br><br>Yours sincerely<br>C.S. Lewis<br><br>I am out of touch with the whole direction given to the debate from the outset. Unless we are wishful thinkers, what we want to know about “Rationalism” and “Religion” is not which (if either) will make us happy but which (if either) is true.<br><br>The word <i>Rationalism</i> has two meanings. (A) The etymological sense: the determined practice of reason. (B) Historically, the name given in the nineteenth century to that school of thought which denied the supernatural. We all alike claim to be rationalistic in sense A. The debate is between those who think that reason leads to “Rationalism” in sense A and those who do not. It would be safer to describe it as a debate between Naturalism and Supernaturalism.<br><br>The case against Naturalism is briefly this:<br><br>1. When any particular thought is known to be the result of irrational causes it is discounted: e.g. when we know that I think this dog is dangerous <i>because</i> I have a complex about black dogs, no one attaches any value to my opinion.<br><br>2. If each individual thought is discounted for having irrational causes, then, should <i>thought in general</i> be shown to have irrational causes, thought in general must be equally discredited.<br><br>3. Now Naturalism asserts that human thought is due to the movement of atoms in the brain, etc., i.e. to irrational causes.<br><br>4.	Therefore if Naturalism is true, all thought is discredited. But Naturalism is itself a thought. Therefore Naturalism is discredited.i.e. Naturalism cuts off the branch it is sitting on. The belief that the human mind is simply a part of that irrational total we call Nature is quite inconsistent with those claims for our reason which Naturalists (like all other thinkers) make.<br><br>5. Put this another way. My reason is either a product of Nature or it is not. If it is, then it is a by-product of natural selection, “selected,” not because its logic yields truth but because its mental habits have “survival value” for mating and food hunting. What reason have we then to suppose that when applied beyond immediate practical matters they will yield truth? But the whole Naturalistic philosophy (atoms, nebulae, paleontology, evolution, matter itself) is precisely such an application “beyond immediate practical matters.” <i>On its own premises,</i> therefore, there is no reason to believe it true. If, on the other hand, my reason is not a product of Nature, then something other than Nature, the extra- or supernatural, exists.<br><br>6. The great argument <i>for</i> Naturalism is, I admit, the limitless cruelty and injustice of Nature. But oddly enough the moment we say this, we are really denying that Nature is all. For “This is unjust” is a moral judgment (M.J.). Now my M.J. is itself either a product of Nature or not. If it is how can I at the same moment trust my M.J. and condemn that Nature which, on this assumption, has doled my M.J. out to me? Seeing the <i>source</i> to be senseless and detestable I ought of course equally to despise the M.J. which comes from it. In which case my condemnation must be abandoned. In reality, of course, at the moment of judging Nature to be bad I am (without noticing it) claiming to be something <i>outside</i> Nature. In fact I am really adopting the alternative hypothesis—that my M.J. does <i>not</i> come from Nature but from some higher reality. The more seriously and confidently you condemn Nature the more you are implying both that there is a Supernature and that you are in some way in touch with it.<br><br>7. If these positions are accepted it follows that Supernaturalism is really involved in the claim we daily make to be able to think at all. After seeing that, one might go on to investigate the usual accounts given of the supernatural. (It will save time to recognize that only <i>two</i> really matter: Hinduism and Christianity. Buddhism is a Hindu heresy and Islam is a Christian heresy. All the vital elements of Paganism, Platonism, Stoicism and Confucianism will be found either in Hinduism or Christianity or in both.)<br><br>8. On “mystical experience”: I wish I had a quite clear definition of the words. If one means “supernatural experience” (i.e. experience one couldn’t have if one were a merely natural being) then we all have it whenever we think rationally. If it means supernatural stages of consciousness then the idea that an enquiry into religion should begin by trying to “get a mystical experience” before you have practiced the religious life seems to me like the idea that the study of geography should begin by trying to sail a ship to America before you’ve learned navigation.<br><br>9. On Reason and Revelation: If the claim “there has been a revelation” is in fact false, then no doubt the acceptance of the supposed revelation will usually involve errors in reasoning. But there is no opposition in principle between Reason and Revelation: for of course those who accept Revelation believe that Reason leads them to regard it <i>as</i> a Revelation. In fact, the relation between Reason and Revelation is like that between Reason and sense-experience: i.e. both supply Reason with materials which she cannot spin out of herself.<br><br>C.S. Lewis",

In the first place, having the next vac. full with R.A.F. lectures and the best part of July with examining, I should have to write in very great haste. Secondly, I very much doubt if this is really the book for me. (A 500-700-word <i>report</i> on the evidence furnished by the R.A.F. to yourself wd. be a different matter.) I hope you will not think that this way of putting it is merely a pompous form of refusal. I mean what I say. If it were argued that only I can judge my own bent, it can also be argued that anyone else is more fit than I from the disturbing element of my own wishes. For that is the real difficulty—to decide when the “bent” or the “grain”, or <i>Minerva</i> is a leading and when it is a temptation. Books a man is set to write by authority may either draw him away from the true vein or recall him to a true vein he would not otherwise have detected.

That was what I replied to. When I discovered it was by you I felt (a.) That I had made sport for the editors of the <i>Tablet</i> by showing two Anglicans fighting at cross purposes in <i>their</i> columns. (b.) That, since I had apparently misunderstood you, my letter might sound ungracious. That is why I wrote to you. Nothing was further from my mind than the idea that people who are friends ought not to criticise one another in public without private warnings and apologies. All that kind of collusion and secret society business in the world of modern literature is my pet abomination. I neither ask nor offer anything but ‘the rigour of the game’.<br><br>As to my failure to follow up the question raised in your original letter to me about de Rougemont, the truth is that I am not very interested in the <i>origins</i> of courtly love.  I raise all the usual theories in the first chapter of my book, dismiss them in a purely agnostic way, and hurry on to my real subject—what the thing was like once it <i>had</i> originated and what sort of poetry it produced. I might go further and say that I am less interested in Courtly Love itself than most people suppose. My real concern was allegory and C.L. originally came in for the sake of studying allegory, not <i>vice-versa</i> as most people think. Temperamentally I find the phase of sexuality exhibited in C.L. <i>most uncongenial.</i> Any strength my book has results from the fact that it is the work of an outsider.*<br><br>I hope it is now clear that I have nothing to ‘forgive’.

In <i>those capacities</i> I of course support the centre i.e. the Dominical and Pauline utterances on marriage.

The whole family moves to Clevedon on 3rd or 4th April.

I know that he is sworn under horrible penalties to keep some of the more ghastly secrets of the hidden circle into which he is initiated, but as I don’t know the form […] I ask at random. I suppose he is not allowed to tell what the thing is worth: but if he is, I should like to know—at any rate roughly. What papers are set? When are the exams held?—and any pertinent things he can tell me. He told me all this once before, I think, but I was not then very keen about it. By the way, am I technically eligible?

        textProvided: "<div style='text-align: center'>THE KINGIS QUAIR<br><br>TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES</div>Sir,—Readers of the “Kingis Quair” will remember the problem of its opening stanzas (1-19). Their content may be briefly analysed thus:— The poet, being unable to sleep, takes up his Boethius in the hope of finding it a soporific, but, growing interested, continues to read far into the night, and finally lays it aside only to reflect on the theme of fortune in general and his own fortune in particular. He is interrupted by the matins bell, which seems to say to him, “Tell on, man, quhat the befell.” This determines him—since he has already spent much paper in vain—to make a new beginning. He therefore makes a cross in his manuscript and begins “his book.” There follow two stanzas on the dangers of youth, one in which he applies the previous two to his own youth, two more in which he compares the difficulties of his literary undertaking to those of a mariner becalmed by night, and a final stanza in which he invokes the Muses.<br><br>The problem is to find the connexion between this apparently rambling induction and the poem which actually follows. Skeat, in the introduction to his text (published for the E.E.T.S. in 1884), regards it as a slab of aimless poetizing composed <i>before</i> the King had seen Joan Beaufort and when he had “no very clear idea as to what he was going to write about.” The new work—<i>i.e.,</i> the work written after he had fallen in love—does not (for Skeat) begin until Stanza twenty-nine. We are to suppose that when James at last <i>had</i> found a theme he collected the several scraps of aimless verse previously composed and tacked them thus clumsily on to the beginning of his new poem. The obvious objection to this theory is contained in Stanza ten (“In tender youth how sche—<i>i.e.,</i> Fortune—was first my fo And eft my frende, and how I gat recur off my distresse”)—lines which must clearly have been written after the success of his suit to Joan Beaufort; and this objection Skeat disposes of by the supposition that these lines were added later, as also the passage in Stanza nineteen (“My turment and my ioye”). It will be noticed that both passages involve rime-words, and that it is therefore a question not of the lines themselves but of the whole stanzas in which they occur. Gregory Smith (in Chapter X. of the Cambridge ‘History of English Literature,” Vol. II.), while rightly protesting against Skeat’s rather drastic surgery, and stating that the poem is a unity, does not explain how that unity manifests itself in the passage we are considering.<br><br>I venture to suggest that the difficulty all arises from the fact that the reader, blinded by the history of James as a <i>man,</i> approaches his induction determined to see in it some reference to that history; but when once we have grasped that James is here speaking not of his history as a man but of his history as a <i>poet,</i> the whole thing becomes clear. Stanzas one to thirteen are an introduction which describes the genesis of the poem. The author tells us he took up Boethius one sleepless night. (It will be noted that it was neither his love nor his imprisonment that kept him awake. Cf. Stanza two: “Can I nought say quharfore.” If we must assume that cares hinder sleep, they were the cares of a poet.) Boethius suggested the idea of Fortune, which inevitably suggested the curious fortunes of his own life—some months ago a lonely prisoner, now an accepted lover soon to return, a free man, with his bride, to Scotland. At this point the matins bell rang and a new idea occurred to him. He had already wanted much paper in the effort to write a Chaucerian poem, but had made little progress. Suddenly—so suddenly that it needed only the slightest conceit to identify the suggestion with the actual sound of the bell—it flashed upon him that his own life provided a capital theme for the sort of poem he had been trying to write. A moment later he would have been seeing how well the circumstances of his falling in love could be worked up on lines of the “Knight’s Tale.” Having thus seen where his real task lay—namely, in using the framework of the allegorical poem for the expression of a personal and actual emotion—he realized that his literary development had entered on a new phase. In fine, the first thirteen stanzas of the “Kingis Quair” correspond almost exactly to Sidney’s first sonnet, and the words “Tell on, man, quhat the befell” are James’s version of “Look in thy heart and write.” (In a modern author the matter of these thirteen stanzas would probably go into a prose preface.) At Stanza fourteen the poem proper begins. The author, after referring to the weakness of youth in general and of his own youth in particular, goes on with a modesty not unusual in medieval poets to express vividly (17 and 18) the sense of his unfitness for the arduous work he has in hand, but finally plucks up courage to invoke the Muses. I would, therefore, divide as follows: (1) Stanzas one to thirteen, autobiographical preface describing the <i>literary</i> genesis of the poem; (2) Stanzas fourteen to nineteen, formal induction to the poem proper, with moral reflections, modest hesitations, and invocation <i>en regle;</i> (3) Stanzas twenty to twenty-eight, first step in the narrative, describing his life previous to the love affair with Joan Beaufort. After this the poem needs no explanation.<br><br>Only those who forget the tendency of young poets to write about poetry itself and the intense feelings which they suffer in connexion with their own poetical progress will think that such a purely literary adventure as I describe is too slight a theme for these stanzas. James himself supplies the answer to such objections. If Stanza seventeen had survived alone out of this poem, would not criticism have supposed that these pathetic lines referred to the author’s misery as a prisoner, or, at least, as a lover? Yet we see from Stanza eighteen that the “rokkis” are only those of “prolixitee” and the “lak of wynd” is only “the deficultee in enditing.”<br><br>Magdalen College, Oxford.<br>C.S. LEWIS.",

Mr. Hardy blames railway companies for entrusting the design of cross-channel ships “too much to shipbuilders,” and urges the elimination of open deck spaces “as far as possible.” If it is too much to hope that there are many travellers left who prefer shipbuilders’ ships, which have beauty, to hotel-keepers’ ships, internally disguised as “old baronial” roadhouses, I suggest that there may yet be some who value the sight, the smell, and the airs of the sea. There are certainly those who find the “open deck spaces” their best safeguard against seasickness. It should not be forgotten that ships of this type are necessarily over-engined, and therefore hot and noisy below decks. The retreat at present left us from such heat and noise, from the blare of the wireless, and the vulgarity of the decorations below, is already very small; need we reduce it to nothing? −Mr. C.S.

Gray traces to Spenser’s experiences of the Irish wars certain passages in the <i>Faerie Queene</i> where knights are represented in conflict with a “rascal many” of robbers, cannibals and other rabble. The purpose of this letter is not to deny Mr. Gray’s thesis. On the main issue I am disposed to agree with him. But there is one argument in his article—an argument which he merely throws out as a buttress and which it would be unfair to press if my purpose were controversial—that I would venture to criticise. We read on p. 414 that “in so far as this poem (sc. <i>The Faerie Queene</i>) was a tale of knight errantry, Spenser followed in the main the example of Malory and of the medieval romance writers, but into the adventures of the knights he introduces a new kind.” Again (p. 415), “Neither Malory nor any of his predecessors in romance provide a precedent for the type of episode in which hordes of savages rush out of the mountains and forests …in mediæval romance the knight rarely encounters the ‘rascal many.’” As against this I would plead, “In so far as this poem was a romantic epic, Spenser followed in the main the examples of Boiardo and Ariosto; and in Boiardo (I do not answer for Ariosto) he found precedent for the type of episode in which knights are attacked by a rabble of robbers or cannibals.”<br><br>[84]If it were necessary at this time of day to prove Spenser’s familiarity with Boiardo, a single quotation would suffice.<br><br><i>F.Q.</i> III, iii, 26.

Is it not rather a canon of Spenserian <i>Quellenforschung:</i> “Never look further for the source of a passage until you have satisfied yourself that it does not come out of the Italian epics”?<br><br>Yours faithfully,<br>C.S.

        textProvided: "THE FUNCTION OF EDUCATION<br><i>To the Editor</i> of THE SPECTATOR.<br><br>SIR,—In your last number Mr. Graham Greene, reviewing Professor Pelham Edgar’s <i>Art of the Novel,</i> states that at Oxford “the Professor of English Literature is a Member of the Book Society Committee.” Why this should be discreditable I need not inquire, for it is untrue. What is more important is the reviewer’s assumption that it is the business of a school of English literature to criticize recent or contemporary work. He is doubtless entitled to hold this view, but not to take it for granted, since it is highly controversial. Most of us at Oxford, I believe, proceed on a premise which Mr. Greene seems to be unaware of, and which may be stated as follows:<br><br>The function of education is to lift the individual out of the provincialism of his own place and time, to liberate him from the tyranny of the immediate, and so to make him more of a man <i>simpliciter</i> and less of a man <i>secundum quid.</i> Hence, as a colleague once laughingly said to me, “a university aims at making a man as unlike his cousins as possible.” For those whose minds tend to the abstract, this liberation is effected by philosophy, science, or mathematics; for those of a more concrete turn, by the various forms of history. Among these, “English Language and Literature” may claim to be the most concrete, studying, as it does, a thousand years, not of war and politics, but of human thought, sentiment, and idiom. With the decay of classical studies, indeed, “English,” thus conceived, bids fair to become the only discipline at our older Universities which still gives a man a living acquaintance with civilizations, modes of expression, and basic assumptions other than his own. We believe that a school of English which adheres to these principles may do invaluable work; by devoting itself to contemporary criticism it would merely abandon that work in order to enter an arena which is already as well supplied with combatants as any temperate spectator can desire.—Yours faithfully,<br><br>C.S.

Miss C. converts this pond into drinking water by the process of straining it thro’ muslin—which, I take it, removes nothing save what is beneficial. In my morning’s washing water I looked down and “oh happy living things I said and blessed them unawares.” (By the way the drinking water may come from a separate well—I rely on our maid’s statement about the muslin, and on conjecture for its pond origin.) The cottage is beautiful. The wood is heavenly. The beach about a mile and a half distant and stony, flat, straight, much divided by groynes, and backed by the sordid beginnings of enterprise.

As for the content, I suppose the “highest tribute” (to prolong the style of your one lapse) I can pay is to say that it gave me disquieting light on my own childhood—one of extreme intellectual precocity—and of its results in the present and so increased self-knowledge.

We are saying, “If he fell he was made of poor stuff.” Does that imply “If he had been made of good stuff he could not have fallen”? If not the whole argument collapses: for if a creature made of good stuff <i>could</i> fall the fact of man’s falling does not prove he was made of bad stuff. If so (i.e. if it does imply this) then we are saying that a really good creature would be incapable of moral choice—which is almost saying, “A good creature means a creature incapable of real goodness.” For surely power to be good and to be bad go together, and when you remove one you remove the other? E.g. take away a creature’s sexuality and you have made not only chastity but unchastity impossible for it. Every new faculty opens up new possibilities both of good and of evil. I don’t think that we show any particular <i>personal</i> stupidity in forgetting this: the truth is that freedom and choice, though we all believe in them are strictly incomprehensible to the human mind. You start by admitting them: but when one tries to think of them one always lets them slip through one’s fingers.",

The exact steps by which what was originally envisaged as advice for private study and even recreational reading became the syllabus for something like an honours course on the university model need not be recapitulated. The initiative came from the prisoners. Miss Herdman and I met their wishes by arranging an examination. A number of scholars offered their services as unpaid examiners, and the German authorities consented to allow the forwarding of the prisoners’ answers. Finally academic recognition was obtained and a decree has handed over to the Board of the Faculty of English at Oxford the duty of nominating examiners. It has not been possible to offer a degree as the result of this examination. The candidates will be admitted to it without any preliminary examinations, and, of course, they will lack matriculation and residence. The papers will, however, be set and marked according the honours standards (though of course with an eye to certain inevitable limitations of reading) and it is hoped that a good class in this examination, backed by a good report from the examiners, will have a definite practical value after the war. On the cultural side I anticipate, along with much bad work, answers of real interest, for I believe that the necessary restriction on bulky works of criticism, literary history, and apparatus, by forcing the students to concentrate on the texts and to digest them more thoroughly and, above all, to find in one great author their chief commentary on another, may have certain positive advantages over the normal procedure.",

Of course Mr. Meyerstein is right in claiming that Milton, like most Humanists, undervalued Aristotle’s major works as much as he reverenced the <i>Poetics</i>.

For there too, of course, the boys with intellectual interests have usually been a minority. But have they acted as a leaven? Did not most of them either learn in their first week to assume the mask which they never laid aside until they reached the university, or else undergo years of such ostracism as turned them into soured intellectuals who are such a feature of our age? The hope that they would have fared better at State schools would be reasonable if we had evidence that proletarian philistines are less hostile, or less successfully hostile, to distinction than philistines from bourgeois homes.

As a citizen, I submit that the members of the Home Guard made a voluntary sacrifice of their leisure at a time when the country was in extreme danger. Since then their service has been made compulsory and their leisure further encroached upon. Both these evils are borne with patience because they are taken as necessary evils. But what shadow of right can the State pretend for using the power it has thus acquired over them to compel them to go to church? Or in what spirit are we to suppose that a man who has lost his Sunday morning for an object which he understands and approves will see his Sunday evening also taken from him for an object which was never even mentioned when he first became a Home Guard? As a Christian, I submit that such interferences with the private life of the Home Guard are calculated to harden ordinary English indifference into fierce anticlericalism of the Continental type. Angry men do not reason clearly. They will transfer to the Church itself the resentment they justly feel for the busy-body who has marched them to it. Some of them no doubt are Christians. But why should a Christian by entering the Home Guard be deprived of the right to go to the church and service he chooses with his own wife and children, or be forced to the difficult exercise of praying amidst a crowd of comrades either bitterly resentful or (worse still) contemptuously patient? War demands compulsions; all the more reason to guard against gratuitous compulsions which it does not demand. By the mere act of putting on uniform men should not be reduced to the status of toy soldiers, moved about for the mere amusement of their owners.<br><br>Yours faithfully,<br>C.S.

        textProvided: "My dear Cecil—<br><br>Your letter, which arrived when I did not feel equal to answering it has now suffered the fate of anything whatever wh. I venture to leave on my table for more than 24 hours, and disappeared. <i>Did</i> you say anything in it about the young lady who wants lodging—the one about whom you wrote to Mrs. Moore yesterday? I can’t remember a word on <i>that</i> subject. At any rate that’s alright. A Mrs. Dodwell (Marcia is her Christian name, tho’ it seems incredible) of Southernmay, Dunston Rd. Old Headington writes to say that she has found the girl a room. The rest of your letter, she bears and all, I do remember—if it was the rest and not the whole. (For I was feeling as Johnson did about Burke “if I were to see Harwood now it would kill me”.) As usual I can only thank you and wish I <i>could</i> come. Never fulfil the threat you once made of ceasing to ask me because I have so often refused. I live in the expectation of being some day a freer man and better friend: but not now. You know what driving an old car is like—the <i>normal</i> running becomes more and more abnormal and there is always a semi-crisis. My family life is like that: no-one’s fault—just old age and the change in society wh. is depriving our own class of its “choreigia.” In other words, by the time my arm is out of a sling and I am able to face the journey (I couldn’t at present) it will be high time for me to make myself useful at home: my prolonged status of “passenger” has already thrown heavy burdens on others. Thank Daphne a thousand times. Hospitality has in these days risen from the rank of courtesy to that of heroic virtue and I never knew anyone who had it in a higher degree. As to why my arm is in a sling—apparently when you remove a foreign body wh. has been so long naturalised, you sometimes get a “flare-up” of all the latent poison. I go to Acland every day and have prongs stuck into it and the matter squeezed out of it. Don’t pity me too much. The process looks revolting but, oddly enough, hurts no more than a lover’s pinch. Nor is there apparently any danger to the arm. As for the stone which was removed from under my tongue, you will be pleased to hear that it must have impeded my speech all these years. So there’s a good time coming. No more will you complain of that taciturnity wh. your kindness so often led you to attribute to modesty. No more will you whisper to Barfield after my rare remarks “If only he’d talk more.” (This reminds me of one of only two good things I found in M. Ward’s <i>Life of Chesterton,</i> viz: on being told “Oh Master Gilbert you’ve got a little baby brother,” G.K. replied “Now I shall always have an audience.” The other good reply was to an American who asked him “Say, Mr. Chesterton, what makes women talk so much?” He answered, “God, Madam.” But a dull book on the whole.)<br><br>I also read <i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i> and the second half of the <i>Aeneid</i>. M.C. is almost my favourite Dickens because in it the melodramatic parts (remember Jonas’s drive to Salisbury with the man he means to murder) are almost as good as the comic ones. <i>Aeneid</i> VII-XII is pure gold: specially VIII. Can you read all this? My writing is becoming no better than yours: partly because I have rheumatism in my right arm—that’s the other arm. I’m writing to Mrs. Dodwell as soon as I’ve finished this. What do you think of Kipling? I have to talk about him in the near future. Am I right in thinking that the essential thing about him is neither patriotism nor imperialism but professionalism—i.e. he’s the first man who has expressed the snug freemasonry between people who share the same work and the same hardship and grievances—the delight of talking shop when “we” are together and enjoy our unity against outsiders and also against the “cubs” and “pups”, the “new bugs” in our own trade who aren’t yet in the know. Up till Kipling fiction had been all about people’s private lives: he first notices this immense vocational bond wh. is in some cases stronger than nationality, religion or family. The strength of his work comes from the fact that the thing he is talking about does really keep the “system of things” running every 24 hours and is responsible for countless heroisms. The sinister side of his work is that he doesn’t seem to know (or perhaps care) that it is also the <i>modus operandi</i>—nay, the very incarnation, of nearly all strong corruption and cruelty. I shd. very much like (as Pecksniff says) to see your ideas on this. I read your sonnet and “Laura” to my literary friends recently. The sonnet, tho’ not misliked, was completely overshadowed by “Laura” wh. everyone admired. Barfield is writing good things at present. I must stop now and write to Marcia D. My love, thanks and regrets to all.<br><br>Yours truly,<br><br>C.S. Lewis",

I got back last night (from giving the Skemp lecture at Bristol) at 11.30 p.m. and read about half the book before turning in. I am delighted with it and, so far, in complete agreement. It come [sic] on top of a suspicion that had recently occurred to me in another context viz: that the commonest cause of bad criticism is one so simple we never suspect it—just not really knowing what happens in the book criticised! One finds it again and again. The basis of the criticism is really some previous critic & thus errors are perpetuated. I had already in a vaguer way taken your view about Falstaff and wondered how any one after the recruiting scene could believe in the idealized F. of modern criticism. But you make it much clearer: and I hadn’t grasped the full reasons for the difference between Pt. I and Pt. II. Your little inscription is over kind. Say rather that some happy fate intended that your book and Tillyard’s Elizabethan Outlook and my Preface shd. all independently & at the same time remind people of the Hierarchical principle. So if they don’t [61] know now, they’re inexcusable! What a pity Masefield wrote that little book! It is so well written that all its errors stick. With very many thanks,<br/><br/>Yours,<br/>C.S.

The “World,” you will remember, is mentioned along with the flesh and the devil. The Flesh means sexual vice (but not marriage), drunkenness (but not drinking) enslave­ment to indulgent habits (but not ××××××, not smoking just as much) and over-eating (but not enjoying one’s meals). The Devil means occultism and magic in all their various forms (spiritualism, astrology, future-telling, avoiding 13, not walking under ladders). The World means worldly ends and ambition (inordinate interest in one’s career, love of money, snob­bery, desire to be in the right set, desire for popular­ity). Of course <i>any</i> of the innocent pleas­ures may have to be given up in a particular extreme: e.g. cards must go if you can’t play without becoming totally absorbed in it and drink must go if you can’t drink without taking too much. But a list of general prohibitions such as you suggest is not in the spirit of Chris­tianity at all: it is more like the old Jewish law, from which, as St. Paul says, we are ‘set free’. The test of an <i>innocent</i> pleasure is whether you can with a clean mind give God <i>thanks</i> for it—as I cer­tainly can for a glass of beer on a hot day but can <i>not</i> for being drunk: can be con­tended without it. It is not the pleasure but the enslavement to an act is bad. I don’t myself know of a particular actor who has been converted—how shd. I—just as I don’t happen to know of a particular postman who has. But I don’t think that means that I must’ve lost the letter.

Like you, I am sorry that Peter and Susan are not coming back to Narnia, but I think, being the two eldest, they are now getting to the age at which people stop having that sort of adventure for a time—they may start having it again later, but not for some years. The new book is called <i>The Voyage of the Dawn Treader</i>. Lucy and Edmund find Caspian (now King of course) on board ship, sailing to the Eastern end of the Narnian world. There will be lots about Reepicheep. And there will be a Sea Serpent, and a Dragon, and lots of strange islands. I do hope you will all like it. I intend to have seven of these stories altogether—that is, four more after the next one. They will be called The Chronicles of Narnia. The <s>fifth</s> sixth book goes right back to the beginning and explains how there came to be that magic Wardrobe in the Professor’s house—for of course you will have guessed that the old Professor must have known something about things like that himself, or else he would never have believed what the children told him. I don’t know yet what will happen in the seventh. What do you think would be a good thing to end the whole series with? Of course Aslan will come into them all.<br><br>I wonder what other books you all like. I like George MacDonald’s two <i>Curdy</i> books, and Tolkien’s <i>The Hobbit,</i> and <i>The Wind in the Willows</i>. Do you write stories yourselves?

Possibly in passing from the three figures you met (yourself fourth in the quincunx) to “attributes of the soul” one is passing from the more real to the less real?

In reality it is beyond all we dared to hope. When they sent Joy home from hospital last April, they sent her home to die. The experienced nurses expected her life to be a matter of weeks. She could not even be moved in bed without a lifting squad of three of us, and, with all our care, we nearly always hurt her.<br><br>Then it began to appear that the cancer had been arrested: the diseased spots in the bones were no longer spreading or multiplying. Then the tide began to turn—they were disappearing. New bone was being made. And so little by little till the woman who cd hardly be moved in bed can now walk about the house and into the garden—limping and with a stick, but walking. She even found herself getting up <i>unconsciously</i> to answer the telephone the other day. It is the unconsciousness that is the real triumph—the body wh. could not obey the most planned volition now begins to act on its own. General health and spirits excellent. Of <i>course</i> the sword of Damocles still hangs over us: or, shd I say, <i>we</i> are forced to be aware of the sword wh. really overhangs all mortals.<br><br>Did I tell you I also have a bone disease? It is neither mortal nor curable: a prematurely senile loss of calcium. I was v. crippled and had much pain all summer but am in a good spell now. I was losing calcium just about as fast as Joy was gaining it, and a bargain (if it were one) for wh. I’m v. thankful. So continue your prayers but now with fervent thanks. I am almost frightened by God’s mercies: how can we ever be good enough?<br><br>I’ve been reading some of the books you mention.

Fame is <i>not</i> dust and ashes as the moralists say. If it were a shovel and a vacuum cleaner wd. put it right. It’s lines.

The Greeks distin­guished the wise man (he who by intelligence discerns timeless truths) from the prudent man (he who knows by tact, skill, and experience how to adapt principles to particular circumstances). I’m neither: but I’m much nearer to wisdom than to prudence. You are prob. much better able to instruct me in that direction than I you. What I think, however, I will now say. The first thing is to acquiesce <i>whole heartedly</i> in the rights of these people not to be visited or talked to if they don’t want. An Englishman’s house is his castle. These people feel that we are hunters and they our prey: and there is a real danger of our wanting too in­temperately to achieve their good by overriding their free will. The second thing, I suppose, is intensive prayer. <br><br>After these two I’m afraid I think the only thing to do is to watch in patience for any oppor­tunities that may occur. I know it sounds feeble: but I am inclined to think that a ces­sation of all overt attempts to “get at them” is the best thing. We all hate the feeling of being “got at” (how wd. you and I like continual solicitations from a Mohammedan mis­sionary?) and the harder you try the more their resistance will stiffen. <br><br>That is how I think.

        textProvided: "The Kilns, Headington Quarry, Oxford, England<br>Sept 25th. 1956<br><br>Dear Mr. Evans—I think the point about visions is this. Unless the apparently divine ones increase our love and obedience to God they do us no good, and unless the apparently dia­bol­ical ones make us proud or uncharitable they do us no harm. Even a delusion wd. be God’s Providence if it had the good effect. And even a really celestial vision would be a disaster if it had the bad one. And perhaps you and I should be cautious about wishing “to do wonderful things for God.” It will be enough (and more than most of us manage) to do His will, leaving it entirely to Him whether His will leads us to wonderful things or to the most hum-drum and unexciting duties. What we can be sure of is that <i>He</i> will do wonderful things <i>for us</i> if we patiently follow Him—tho’ most probably they will not be the sort of things that look “wonderful” to the outer world!<br><br>I don’t see any grammatical mistakes in your letter!<br><br>With all good wishes,<br>Yours sincerely<br>C.S.

        textProvided: "Magdalen etc<br>Nov. 30th. 1948<br><br>Dear Miss Monro<br><br>Your letter came more <i>à propos</i> than you could have expected for I spend most of my spare time in looking after an elderly invalid and have been forced, like you, to think about the apparent decay of the mind. The experience that seems to me to give us the key is one you have probably had if you ever slept in a school dormitory. Surely you must have addres­sed a schoolfellow who was asleep and nevertheless got an answer? These answers made by a sleeper are sometimes apparently rational (tho’, in that case, usually trite and mechanical), sometimes inconsequent: they might even be shock­ing. One is so familiar with the phenom­e­non of sleep that one forgets what a mystery it is: and one does not doubt that next morning God will “raise” the sleeper and full ratio­nal­ity will reappear. The same thing can happen in artificial anaesthesia, when the patient sometimes speaks semi-rationally or irrationally. Now I take senility to be roughly the same kind of thing. The organism is in a state verging on sleep. And what of the soul? Well, what of the soul in ordinary sleep? Where—and what—was my soul for several hours last night? This is an absolute mystery and wd. “harrow us with fear and won­der” if we weren’t used to it.<br><br>For some reason we are less puzzled by a total absence of the soul—say, in deep sleep or wholly unconscious senility—than by the partial absence of the sleep talker or the old per­son whose mind is merely feeble and feebler one day than another. But that might be be­cause we conceive the relations of soul & body too crudely. It is very diffi­cult to get rid of the idea that the soul is “inside” the body as the body is inside the clothes. But surely it is just as likely that “connection” or <i>rapport</i> is the proper term and that the connection admits of innumerable de­grees from the complete incarnation of an alert adult in full health to the almost, but not quite, severed connection of an uncon­scious man who may die at any moment—the cord stretched out to the utmost but not yet snapped.<br><br>When I was a materialist I used the phenomena of senility as an argument against im­mor­tal­ity. “These old men,” I said, “Are obviously falling asleep: how can you ask me to believe that they are preparing for a great voyage into a larger life? But the ans­wer might be that they are not preparing for it because they have already <i>begun</i> it: the ship is already moving away from the quay tho’ the last moorings have not yet been cast off. The collo­quial “He’s not all there” may be a more exact expression than we sup­pose. And having seen people wake from sleep and “come round” from faints or opera­tions, I find no diffi­culty in believing that God will restore to the soul which is gradually losing touch with the earthly organism another organism in which it will function better than ever.<br><br>In infancy, too, much that we mistake for the immaturity of the soul might be due to the fact that it is not yet <i>fully</i> incarnated, has not fully settled down in the organism. Thus one wd. have <i>full</i> incarnation in adult life as the Norm, with a twilight at each end, a morning twilight as the soul gradually establishes her grip on brain & tongue and an evening twilight when she is gradually relaxing it. Both of course involve Dependence. And why not? We are really de­pendent all the time (blankets & clothes that others made, food that others pro­duced, books that others wrote) and the more we know it the better. One of the functions of old age may be to kill the false belief in independence wh. some of us suffer from in middle life. For we must live on one another. As Charles Williams taught the one canoo that you can least pad­dle is your own. “He saved others, Himself He cannot save” is true of everyone as well as of Christ.<br><br>I don’t share the Canon’s difficulty about recognition of those who die in childhood. Here, one never meets more than a moment any cross section of a man (this letter is be­ing written not by me-in-general but by me-at-10.40 a.m. Nov. 30, 1948). But surely you don’t think it will be like that in Heaven? Surely the <i>total</i> man, here divided up into all his mo­ments, will in some unimaginable way co-exist: so that <i>all</i> your Fathers (his childhood, manhood, and old age, asleep and awake) will meet you. You only have a series of snap­shots here.<br><br>The lion is quite ready to be attacked in its den if you think fit—by appointment al­most any weekday morning.<br><br>Yours sincerely<br>C.S. Lewis",

Christopher dined with me a few weeks ago and seems well and cheery, but it was rather a big and rowdy party and there was no opportunity of seri­ous conversa­tion. I have been able to see very little of undergraduates lately (apart from teaching my own pupils) because my mother is now so old and infirm that I have to spend all the hours I possibly can at home. But I hear excellent reports of your son as a most use­ful member of the college, who somehow manages that his medical disability shd be sin­gu­larly little trouble to other people.

Some American company is going to make a film of Screwtape, by the bye! I can’t imagine what it will be like. I believe it could be done—humans silent, only the devils speaking, an ap­pal­­ling face materialising now & then in what looks an ordinary social scene.

This enabled me to gauge how clear you were making things—for of course all expositions seem easy if we start by knowing what is expounded. Frankly, I don’t think your pp. 2-6 are as lucid as they ought to be and can, no doubt, be made by re-writ­ing. First of all one is started on a false trail by version. Then comes the absolute mystery at the bottom of p. 5. “Agreement between MSS” usually means agreement in readings be­tween MSS of the same work. “Agreement in content” doesn’t clear matters up. No one expected them to agree in shape or size? Nor is the student given any hint why SK, SM etc. are being mentioned at all. Could you not use a good many more words making clear what you are going to tabulate and <i>why</i> before you go on to the tabulation? And wd. the earlier part run more easily in the order<br><br>1.

About SK, SM etc.<br>I am probably being stupid, but some of your other readers may be so too. After that, you got much easier. I enclose my notes, of very varying importance. If you revise (but you ought to let someone else vet it too) I suggest that changes shd. be all in the di­rec­tion of simpler (and there­fore more elegant) syntax and always the most precise or most obvious word. Often, see <i>object</i> for <i>substance</i> on p. 45 these coincide.

I objected in one place not to your manner but to your <i>ordon­nance</i> as need­lessly difficult. I object to “substance” (of a desire or hope—I forget which it was) be­cause I don’t know what it means. Is it the thing hoped for or desired? if so, surely more peo­ple wd. under­stand “object”? Is it the “substance” of this hope or desire as distinct from its accidents? If so—<i>tantamne rem tam negligenter!</i> We’d need a lot more help. If it means neither of these, then I just don’t understand it at all. Others may. There is no need to take my deci­sion as final.<br><br>I don’t, myself, want the introduction made shorter. If the publisher absolutely insists then your only two courses are<br><br>a. To go through saving a sentence and even a word here and there. I have found it is wonderful how many words one <i>can</i> save that way (what a critique this is on my own style!) but of course there is great danger of obscurity—as Horace taught us!<br>b. To jettison matter. I suppose some of the theology wd. have to be sacrificed.<br>c. Possibly the philological part could be made more purely tabular and done separate as smaller type.<br><br>But it wd. be much nicer to do none of these things.<br><br>yours<br>C.S. Lewis",

I like this edition v. much; the Introduction is one of the best we have had. My comments turn on smallish points, except for those on the editor’s treatment of “convention” and “topics.” Some of this might be reconsidered. At least I feel that Curtius’ tendency to consider literature a closed system which feeds solely on itself has been a misleading inference.<br><br>The notes tell us what they ought, but I think they wd. stand the pruning knife. Are you sure that our series is not overdoing the “parallel passage” business? The primary use of paral­lels, <i>me judice</i>, is to make clearer what is difficult in the text before us. Next comes their use as evidence that this poet was indebted to this or that predecessor. Illustrative of the general homo­geneity of a whole school, I shd. put third; the Introduction makes that clear enough. But when it comes to citing parallels for “God wot” or “worth £1000,” does it not become ridiculous? When you or I are <i>using</i> the edn., aren’t the parallels the point of the notes we find least useful, and don’t they irritate us by burying in a mass of irrelevancies the things we turn to the notes to find?<br><br>I suppose I now stand by till the notes on AL arrive?<br><br>Yours<br>C.S.

Thus I cherish Daphne and Cecil with my prayers and speed them with my vows. For you there awaits—I weary the shrines of the Gods (with my prayer that it be so)—the sea’s expansive smile and the paths of ocean tranquil in the light of the moon. May your sails be billowing even now with a lucky wind. The Isles of the Blest are in sight and through the pale night their beaches rustle sweetly beneath the impact of the slow withdrawing, greenly shining wave. Already you may see through the mist a lofty summit of grass and trees, may hear the whispering of the foliage of the forests of the Hesperides: where golden apples weigh down their branches, where the nightingale with her melodious voice sings and will be singing. Ceaseless, for all time; where winters do not destroy flowers, or heat scorch the grass.<br><br>Here, as they tell, it is permitted to a few, who are guided by smiling Venus and Saturnian Juno, whose faith is inviolate, and who are wise in their dealings with the world. Here it is allowed them to divert their wearied barque through shallows loud with the songs of Sirens, and no-one forbids it. What is not lawful to virgins and learned poets? Here it is right to disembark, here it is right for once to pace with mortal feet immortal ground and to visit the groves of the blest and approach the fountains of the everlasting gods, though creatures of a day. Perchance in you too a solemn amazement may {48} arise, as you bethink you: The sea, the air, the star-studded vault of heaven are still in place: the wayfarings of sun and moon go on, and the fruitful year passes through season to season. Why does not the Moon leap drunken from the sky, seeking her fair Endymion? How comes it that the fiery Earth does not ravish the loves of the dying Heavens and scatter them in pregnant ruins? What! The laws of nature abide unchanged? Everything going on as usual? Do they behold our joy?<br><br>O sacred powers! All motion is born of love (or Venus). Desperately the parched earth loves the dew, the river, the ocean, the sky. So Form loves willing Matter, and day loves night; so the indwelling spirit loves the friendly body, God loves man, and pleasure loves tears. And within such a furnace, such a maelstrom of love, the mechanism of the breathing world, calmly relying on its proper forces, remains inviolate.<br><br>Only be ye not unmindful of an old friend. As long as your delightful wanderings keep you far from here, among fragrant woodlands where your island echoes with the gentle sound of water, out of many fountains leave one untested by your lips: eschew the sweet waters of Lethe.]",

With a cry<br>He rushes forth; they to the surface fly.<br>Then for a moment mirth gives place to fear<br>And laughter changes to the frightened tear.<br>This mood prevails for but a little while<br>And soon return the scorn and mocking smile.<br>They tantalize with dance the tiny king,<br>The waters wide with wanton laughter ring.<br>Then darts the ugly imp with wanton eyes,<br>They dive and swim and to the surface rise:<br>As now he almost seems to grasp the maids,<br>And merrily they fly before his raids.<br>Anon the nymphs, made frail by easy life,<br>Grow faint and weary of the heated strife:<br>Alberich glories in his sinews strong<br>And knows he may maintain the chase for long:<br>For as they whirl and circle, laughter dies<br>And joy from weary countenances flies,<br>In vain they seek by wiles the dwarf t’elude<br>Nor longer can resist his sallies rude.<br>To one, as in despair the maidens swim,<br>A scheme suggests itself by which the whim<br>Of Alberich the base they may evade:<br>Above them in a cleft the treasure laid<br>Would tantalize the dwarf far more than they.<br>And with this thought she upwards wends her way<br>And, drawing back the curtain which obscures<br>The Rhinegold, by a call the dwarf allures,<br>Who, glancing upward through the water cold,<br>With greedy eyes espied the glint of gold.<br>As eagerly he sees the metal shine<br>No more he heeds the maids of form divine.<br>The glimmer and the gold his senses please<br>And up he dashes, arms outstretched to seize<br>The hoard. But like a dreamer in his sleep<br>He sinks repulsed and floundering in the deep<br>By force invisible, and does not reach<br>The gold. The nymphs with loud unguarded speech<br>Thus to each other: “Knows he not the key<br>By which alone the hoard his own may be?<br>Knows he not as he tries to grasp in vain<br>The treasure, that who would the Rhinegold gain<br>Must first curse love before his hands may hold<br>The glistening and so much desired gold.<br>And he, should he but gain the pile he wants<br>(If there be truth in legendary vaunts)<br>If to a RING he forge it by the art<br>Of goldsmith, then to rule shall be his part;<br>Whoe’er the treasure keeps and wears the RING<br>Shall rule the world, and everlasting king.<br>But Alberich, the basest slave of sense<br>Will never frame the destined curse: and hence<br>The treasure ne’er will gain.” The greedy gnome<br>As eagerly he through the waves did roam,<br>To hear the maidens voice did not appear<br>And yet their every word his open ear<br>Drank in: And with a cry of triumph fierce<br>He upwards strove the tepid waves to pierce.<br>Then cursed he love; nor did the force this time.<br>Repulse the squalid king of Nibelheim.<br>He clutched the pile, and with a mournful cry<br>The maids beheld their hope of safety die.<br>And with lugubrious strokes, no longer quick,<br>They swim away. The darkness gathers thick,<br>And Alberich with gait of triumph proud<br>Approaches through the soft and sedgy shroud,<br>And at the tunnel’s mouth he stops and calls<br>Down to th’ infernal kingdom of the trolls.<br>“Come up ye dwarfs, come up and greet your king;<br>For he has gained the Rhinegold and the ring.”<br>The Nibelungs come up, an ugly throng<br>With tattered garb and muscles coarse and strong.<br>The darkness thickens at the dwarfs approach<br>And noxious fumes upon the light encroach.<br>With joy they gather round like busy ants<br>And bear the treasure to their secret haunts;<br>Beneath the rolling Rhine the pile they lay<br>In jet black caves, far from the light of day.<br>The darkest hour it was before the light<br>Of dawn had burst upon the silent night;<br>The mountain of the gods enveloped stood,<br>Surrounded by the dense, mysterious shroud.<br>Then rose the sun upon the fertile hill,<br>Which beareth fruit although no ploughman till,<br>And touched with fire, Valhalla’s stately hall,<br>Tinging each buttress and each turret wall:<br>Reared by the hands of giants was the place<br>Fit home for members of th’ immortal race.<br>For Wotan, chief of all the gods, desired<br>A hold of strength, and Logie him inspired<br>(The god of fire, who Wotan most advised<br>And by his cunning many a scheme devised)<br>To compact with the mighty giants twain<br>Fasolt and Fafnir, monsters of the plain<br>To rear a hall. And as their price they claim<br>The goddess fair of love, to whom the name<br>Was Freia. Wotan gave a sad consent<br>To sacrifice which he had never meant;<br>And trusted Logic’s wisdom to regain<br>The captive from the giants of the plain.<br>Thus, as the dawn was breaking, lay the god<br>Before the castle on the verdant sod;<br>The light caressed with gentle touch his form,<br>His noble visage, free from passion’s storm,<br>His golden beard, and arms and limbs divine.<br>As on the herbage lay the god supine<br>Closed were his eyes, and sweet, refreshing sleep<br>The mighty king in soft embrace did keep.<br>Some paces off another form reclined<br>Of tender beauty like a mountain hind,<br>‘Twas Frika, Wotan’s everlasting spouse.<br>Then Wotan did himself from dreams arouse,<br>And, rising, turned and viewed his noble home,<br>Let his dark eye o’er every cornice roam.<br>Then with majestic anthem greets the hall:<br>“Fit shelter for the lord and king of all!<br>Valhall! My home! Oh be thou strong and blessed,<br>Standing so firmly by the light caressed<br>See! How vermilion grows each stony point.<br>How flames like fire each wooden beam and joint:<br>Yet grim foreboding in my heart prevails,<br>Whispering, fearful, half unuttered tales.”<br>Then turning to the goddess, Wotan cried:<br>“Awake, Oh Frika: wake my holy bride.<br>Come: let us enter our new built abode.<br>And taste the fruits which Logic’s wit hath sowed<br>In Walhall’s hall we’ll dwell in peace and for aye.”<br>And Frika waking, said: “I know not why,<br>The name seems strange: and unaccustomed fears<br>Rise in my heart and urge the burning tears.<br>Can all be well, if Logie you inspires<br>To sell a goddess for your own desires?<br>Freia, bring Friea back, with her departs<br>Our happiness from faint and sickened hearts.”<br>To whom the god with gravity replies:<br>“Ah, wipe the sorrow from those streaming eyes;<br>I did not wish the goddess fair to sell<br>But power of Logie’s speech thou knowest well.<br>Advised by him – and let this bring you cheer –<br>I somehow hope to save our Freia dear.<br>By counsels smooth and words we will regain<br>The loved one from the monsters of the plain.”<br>He spoke. And at that moment from below,<br>With those quick steps which terror’s anguish shew<br>Freia herself came with dishevelled hair<br>And bloodless cheeks, and all her visage fair<br>Was strained with fear as o’er the turf she trod,<br>Full eagerly: and now she eyed the god.<br>“False traitor! Thou should’st my protection be<br>Oh save me from the monster’s grasp.” Thus she.<br>And even as she spoke, with heavy tread<br>Approached the cumbrous objects of her dread.<br>With slow and awkward gait the giants move,<br>And slowly dog the goddess fair of love.<br>First comes Fasolt, the kindlier of the two,<br>Armed with a mighty tree like weapon, who<br>For her own sake the goddess sad desires:<br>But Fafnir a far different plan inspires,<br>Reflects he thus as up his way he wends:<br>“Tis Freia who the golden apples tends,<br>Of which the gods immortal eat and live.<br>Were she not there the duteous care to give,<br>The gods must some day pass in death away,<br>I, with Fasolt, will hold unbounded sway<br>O’er all the world.” As thus the giant thought,<br>Him one more pace before great Wotan brought.<br>Thus halting near the god the monster stands<br>Towering o’er him with his spread out hands.<br>Then thus with voice of thunder he addressed<br>The god: “Oh mighty lord of Valhall blessed.<br>We come the bargained price you owe to claim,<br>Fulfill your vows or yield t’eternal shame.”<br>The troubled thoughts on Wotan’s brain encroach,<br>For he expects the god of fire’s approach,<br>By whose aid only can he hope to gain<br>A triumph o’er the monsters of the plain.<br>He glances round and falters in his speech,<br>Retreating with a step from Fafnir’s reach.<br>The giant sees the step, and on his brow<br>The anger grows. Then: “Dost remember how<br>I reared for you Valhalla’s stately hall<br>And likewise could remove your home, your all?”<br>Said he. The prudent god, composed, replies:<br>“Fafnir! Suspect me not of ugly lies.<br>While I the woeful news to Freia tell,<br>I’ll send you two of those who round me dwell,<br>Immortal gods, with converse to beguile<br>The space of time.” He speaketh such things while<br>The molten glow of anger in the eyes<br>Of Fafnir quickened as he heard the lies.<br>Then leading Freia, Wotan inward goes.<br>To twain of the immortal gods he shows<br>His plans, and tells them how with words to cheat<br>The giants while he waits the god of heat.<br>The two were Froh, the laughing god of joy,<br>And Donner, god of thunder. They employ<br>The time with oily words and counsels fair.<br>Fasolt, the lover, scarce delay can bear.<br>Thus the four great ones grouped together stood,<br>The giants’ anger boiling in their blood:<br>Opposed to Fafnir stood the god of joy,<br>A laughing, fair, and well appointed boy.<br>And Donner stood and wielded in his hand<br>A mighty mallet which might crush a land,<br>With louder rhetoric and clumsier speech<br>To Fasolt patience he desires to teach:<br>In whose blue eyes the fire flames fiercer still,<br>Nor can he more control his yearning will,<br>His conversation flags and terser grow<br>His short replies: his twitching fingers shew<br>How tense his longing. Then at last he cries:<br>“No more of this. Arise, Oh Fafnir, rise.<br>And let us take the goddess in our hands<br>And bear her off from Walhall’s wordy lands.”<br>Thus speaking, both the giants think t’advance,<br>And Donner sees then harsh and meaning glance;<br>The god of thunder did no more delay<br>But sought to check their onslaught by a way<br>Of reasoning so sure, that none could stand<br>Against its power – the mallet in his hand.<br>Ah! Ne’er the giant had aris’n again<br>Did but that blow descend with stunning pain;<br>But as the god for his fierce stroke drew back,<br>And in the effort every bone did crack,<br>Valhalla’s door with creaking groanings oped,<br>And Wotan brought the friend for whom he’d hoped;<br>For by the hand he led a slender god,<br>In burning robe, in burning sandals shod:<br>His frame was thin, nor was his stature great,<br>His raven eyes with varied thoughts dilate.<br>He counts and counts again his every wile,<br>And whispers in his master’s ear the while.<br>Then Wotan sees the mallet raised to strike<br>And rushes in between th’opponents like<br>A flash of lightening. Grasps he Donner’s arm,<br>And stays the blow and rectifies the harm.<br>Then turns the god to Loge and enquires:<br>“Where have you been? What thought your brain inspires?”<br>To whom Red Fire replying, forward stands:<br>“Obedient have I been to your commands.<br>And scoured the stretching earth from end to end<br>To find what might our sorry bargain mend<br>And love replace: but useless was the task,<br>I could not find the substitute you ask.<br>Nor found I any mortal high or low<br>Who Freia’s gentle favour would forgo.<br>But while I searched for one decided thing,<br>I many others found of moment, King.<br>One thing there was; which threatened all the earth<br>With downfall dire; and this new power’s birth<br>I will relate. In yonder wand’ring Rhine,<br>Three maidens dwelled, you know, of form divine;<br>Who in their keeping held a hoard of gold,<br>Which they have guarded from the days of old.<br>But this mysterious virtue has the thing:<br>Whoe’er shall forge the metal to a ring<br>All earth shall rule – aye, gods as well as men.<br>How would it fare with mighty Walhall then?<br>But all was well. The nymphs dreamed not of power,<br>Nor pondered aught beyond the fleeting hour.<br>Thus far ‘twas well: but only for a time,<br>Until the king of hollow Nibelheim<br>Ascending, stole the treasure from the maids:<br>They, helpless victims, fell before his rage.<br>I pitied them and – pray forgive me king –<br>I did therein an uncommanded thing,<br>Exceeding thy high mandates: I did swear<br>Valhall assistance to their cause would bear.”<br>Thus did narrate th’ intriguing god of fire,<br>And did a thought great Fafnir’s brain inspire.<br>Forward he dashed, and cried: “I beg thee, stay.<br>And hear my words.” And Wotan answered: “Say<br>Fafnir what things you wish. Our ears are aped.”<br>Fasolt thus hotly: “I had fondly hoped<br>Freia to gain: But since you do not choose<br>To give her up, I will not therefore lose<br>My whole reward. Freia to thee I’ll give,<br>(So may she always in Valhalla live).<br>Give me that treasure which the god of fire<br>Hath told us of: for that I most desire.”<br>“The treasure,” answered Wotan, “Is not mine;<br>The greedy dwarfs who stole it from the Rhine<br>Will doubtless hold it dearer than their lives.<br>And if a god with Nibelungen strives<br>Who shall prevail? Although our mighty arms<br>And pow’r divine secure us from alarms<br>Of martial foes: the cunning gnomes may snare<br>Our person by their wiles, did we but dare<br>Their noisome caverns where in gloom they dwell;<br>I fear their hidden, untried depths of hell.”<br>Then answered Loge with a hidden sneer:<br>“Tis not alone to face the regions drear<br>Of Nibelheim, descending from above<br>Is needful. But the hero must curse love<br>To gain the gold.” Then Wotan stood aghast<br>Although the passion of his youth was past,<br>And doted he on power, he could not make<br>His lips the curse to frame and love forsake.<br>So casts he on the ground a troubled eye:<br>The giants see he fears to make reply<br>“Accept you not the liberal terms we make?<br>So be it. Freia then we justly take.”<br>So Fafnir spoke; but Wotan, plunged in thought<br>Scarce heard the words, nor saw what sense they brought.<br>Then the two giants can restrain no more<br>Their purpose, but they open wide the door<br>Of Valhall: and bring forth the goddess sad.<br>Oh Freia, thou who once more glad than all<br>In freedom roamed, nor did one care appall<br>Thy gentle breast, what sorrow now you bear!<br>Nor do the giants in their haste forbear<br>To one of Asgard’s great immortal race<br>To offer sacrilege and durance base:<br>Freia they lead away: with mournful tread,<br>Herself she sadly suffers to be led,<br>Nor strives with petty strength the fates to move,<br>Resigned, descending from the realms above.<br>Then Logie to his master turned and said:<br>“‘A gloomy day for Asgard dawns ahead:<br>Think not with impious words that I would strive<br>The righteous sorrow from your heart to drive,<br>I know your grief – indeed I share your pain.<br>But if Valhalla ere would raise again<br>Her haughty head above the hated clouds,<br>And cleanse her from the woe which now enshrouds<br>Her stately halls, we must to warfare turn,<br>Nor let the sorrow more our spirits burn.<br>For think of this: she is not here to tend<br>The golden apples. Who the want may mend?<br>By these alone the gods immortal live.”<br>He spoke. And Wotan studious ear did give.<br>And all the gods who stood around did quake,<br>And frigid fear their every bone did shake;<br>Should Wotan not the goddess fair regain,<br>No more the gods immortal, free from pain,<br>Could hope to dwell: and thus on every hand<br>In speechless agony th’immortals stand.<br>And as they stand, a deathlike mist descends,<br>And with these words the god his thoughts now ends:<br>“No more of this: we do but waste the time.<br>Let us descend to tunnelled Nibelheim:<br>There may we gain the treasure and the RING<br>The one will gain our Freia, one a king<br>Of all the world for aye myself will make,<br>If I but love will curse and love forsake.”<br>Guide me, my muse, down yonder sloping way,<br>Far lead me from the happy light of day.<br>Let us descend by clefts, where fathoms deep<br>The Nibelungs their hollow city keep.<br>Here, in the regions of eternal night,<br>By pumice rocks enclosed: where never light<br>With shining radiance spreads its warming ray,<br>Nor morning dawns, nor differs night from day:<br>And hidden from the winds and waves and storms,<br>There dwells the race, of small ungainly forms,<br>More hideous far than fancy can devise.<br>And in all cunning knowledge are they wise:<br>Ready to plot and scheme for others harm.<br>And here they dwell secure from all alarm:<br>Dark is the cave, suffused with ruddy glow,<br>And rocky arches propped on pillars low<br>Support its roof of clay. And in the light<br>Of some red furnace gleaming through the night,<br>A goldsmith’s forge of tiny size is seen,<br>The glare returning with a brighter sheen<br>From every burnished point. And heated air<br>Resounds with wild mysterious whispers there,<br>And taps of naked feet on earthy floors,<br>And creaking of the hinges and the doors<br>Of dark and unknown side apartments few<br>Would dare to penetrate. And waters blue<br>With phosphorescent glare, in one weird coin<br>Rush down the world’s internal lake to join.<br>Then in the firelight’s ruddy glow appeared<br>A tiny dwarf of visage dark and weird:<br>‘Twas Alberich, the king of Nibelheim,<br>And by the ear he dragged another – Mime,<br>A larger dwarf of uglier visage yet,<br>And in his eyes the tears of rage were wet;<br>Nor was his chin adorned by flowing beard<br>Like that of Alberich at whom he leered<br>– Now spitefully, by hidden hatred shook,<br>Now with a cringing and submissive look.<br>To him with rage began the angry king:<br>“You idle dog! You worse than useless thing!<br>Have you not learned my mandates to obey,<br>And execute my words without delay?<br>Nor idly sit, yourself with peace to gorge:<br>Where is the headgear that I bade you forge,<br>The cap, the Tarnhelm from the stolen gold?<br>Hast thou forgot the crafts thou knew of old?”<br>Then Mime’s shrill voice through all the caverns rang:<br>“Tis wrong that you should bitterly harangue<br>Your most obedient slave. The cap you bade<br>The cunning smith to forge, that cap is made.<br>Nor does the work disgrace my stablished art:<br>Full well have I fulfilled my humble part.”<br>Thus, honey in his mouth, but in his brain<br>Hatred, the fruit of long endured pain,<br>The smith stooped down towards the pumice floor<br>And picked a bundle from amongest the store<br>Of instruments that to the forging trade<br>Pertain: the pack was in rich cloth arrayed,<br>And tenderly he did unfold the wrap;<br>Then in the firelight gleamed the golden cap.<br>“Behold,” he cried, “the work is here to see:<br>Which willingly, my king, I give to thee.”<br>Then Alberich, with eager hands acquired<br>The trinket which his heart so much desired:<br>His eyes with secret triumph glistened while<br>He placed it on his head and with a smile<br>The goldsmith gnome surveyed. But not alone<br>The fact that such a headgear was his own,<br>So finely wrought, so well with gems arrayed,<br>And to the proper form so fitly made<br>That with such joy inspired him, but he knew,<br>That if the legend of the Rhine were true,<br>Which for the Tarnhelm – so the cap was named<br>This virtue for the golden helmet claim;<br>Whoe’er the headgear wore, at any time<br>What form he wished could take. And therefore Mime,<br>Who thought the cap must hold some power divine<br>Was loath to forge the metal of the Rhine<br>To that which would his hated king endow<br>With powers new. The other gladly now,<br>The cap upon its head, its virtue tried:<br>As standing by his cunning servant’s side<br>One instant he was seen, the next the air<br>Was empty: to the loathing smith’s despair<br>A scourge unseen his trembling limbs did greet,<br>And empty air upon his back did beat.<br>In vain he falls in terror on the ground,<br>And pity begs with noisy wailing sound:<br>Then, still invisible, the cruel king<br>Through the dark cave his unseen path did wing,<br>And leaves the smith in tears upon the floor.<br>Then opened from behind the cavern’s door –<br>Ye gods! What light, what radiancy divine,<br>Fails to recite this earthly pen of mine,<br>Which that dark cavern flooded as the forms<br>Of two fair gods appeared. Their presence warms<br>The cavern with a glow it n’er had known;<br>Leaps out the furnace then to meet its own,<br>(For Logie and his master, Wotan, came<br>The gold they wished by stealth or arms to claim).<br>That furnace which before with ruddy beams<br>Had lit the place, now over feeble seems<br>Compared with that great, more than mortal light<br>Which from th’ immortal places broke the night.<br>And like as when a housewife with a lamp,<br>Invades some cellar full of stores, and damp<br>The rats with evil patterings haste away,<br>Recoiling from the glare in wild dismay:<br>So crowds of Nibelungen, right and left,<br>To hidden caves rush off. Alone, bereft<br>Of terror by his pain, the smith lies prone,<br>His wounds and sad existence does bemoan.<br>Then Wotan, drawing nearer, kindly says:<br>“Explain, good dwarf, what grief your soul dismays.”<br>And eagerly the moaning dwarf returned,<br>“Long has the wish for fitting vengeance burned<br>In this poor soul of mine. Didst thou but know<br>What tyranny I daily undergo<br>From Alberich’s hand, the hateful king,<br>The owner of the thrice accursed ring,<br>Then would your hearts be moved. I pray you hear<br>My tale of woe. Nor spurn the crushed out tear.<br>I daily live in terror of my lord,<br>Alternate blows receive of scourge and sword.”<br>So spoke he weeping; then the god of fire<br>Said: “If you, dwarf, deliverance desire<br>From your tormentor, listen to my words:<br>We come to conquer wealth, but not with swords.<br>By cunning shifts and wiles we seek to gain<br>The Rhinegold. And if you to cruel pain<br>Would bid farewell to aye and free become,<br>Help us to gain the treasure of your home.”<br>As Mime, the cunning smith, would make reply<br>The caverns shudder with a painful cry,<br>And from the darkest corners of the place,<br>The members of the Nibelungen race,<br>Rush wearily with cries and tears of woe:<br>The lights of fire and gods their driver show,<br>The squalid king approaches; whip in hand,<br>Before him drives a Nibelungen band.<br>Then holds he high above his head the ring,<br>And yearns for all the triumph it will bring:<br>And mighty schemes revolves his tiny breast,<br>A swelling heart in narrow body pressed;<br>And all his being trembles with delight,<br>Grasping the gold, with golden headgear dight.<br>As thus he stands in rapt and joyous pose,<br>The gods their presence in these words disclose:<br>“Hail, mighty king. We know your Stirling worth,<br>Nor, being wise, despise your dwarfish birth.<br>We come our due respect as brother kings<br>To pay. Valhalla worthy homage brings.”<br>And Alberich in scorn does make reply:<br>“Tis false, ye gods: and hast thou thought that I<br>Like some young child, by honeyed words deceived<br>Imagine I have homage true received.<br>Ye lying race of gods. I loathe ye all,<br>As you despise my body dark and small<br>And puny height, so I a fiercer shame<br>Impute to Asgard’s oft repeated name.<br>What virtue have you in your godly pow’r,<br>What though Valhalla’s mountains dimly tower<br>O’er all the ages? Didst thou by thine own<br>Unaided power this gain? No: ‘tis well known,<br>The dark unknowable which men call fate<br>Set up the immortal objects of our hate:<br>Supplied them with dominion undeserved,<br>With immortality their throne preserved;<br>Thus tyrants helped by destiny, a blind<br>Unthinking power, they left all woes behind,<br>And lived forever in their haughty home.<br>Now of these tyrants lying, twain have come<br>To offer homage as they say. Do gods<br>Descend the dark and unfrequented roads<br>That lead to my dark realm, respects to pay<br>To Alberich? Or leave the glowing day<br>To seek the caverns of a king they hate?<br>Or doth the eagle with the beetle mate?<br>Am I a child that I should thus believe<br>Ye come love-laden spirits to relieve<br>With kindly words? Nay: never was there yet<br>A god but did all misery beget<br>With lofty schemes. The price of Asgard’s good<br>Is running rivulets of human blood.<br>To better your estate ye gladly slay<br>Crowds of the bad: the good alike dismay.<br>Through all the ages war has been between<br>Thy race and mine. And do th’ immortals mean<br>These words of homage as an ill timed jest,<br>Or do the dotards really strive their best<br>My spirit to deceive? Which ’re it be,<br>I care not!! Get ye gone from mine and me,<br>But stay. Before the hated schemers go,<br>To them their coming ruin I would show:<br>Although devoid of power my person seems,<br>The golden pile that in yon crevice gleams<br>Hath made me lord of all. Nay, start not so,<br>Ye did not deem a prince to meet below.<br>The ring this Nibelungen finger wears,<br>The Tarnhelm which this wrinkled forehead bears<br>My kingdom they set up. Ah! what a jest.<br>The power fate, which once of all its best<br>Gifts to Valhalla’s gave, that very same<br>Fate hath prepared its downfall and its shame:<br>The ring hath made me monarch of ye all,<br>Valhalla’s stately realms I will enthrall:<br>From harms I always easily escape,<br>The Tarnhelm gives me power to change my shape.<br>And when the world’s broad kingdom is my joy,<br>Schemes for your torture will my brain employ:<br>I once to gain this ring sweet love did curse,<br>Now I will not than Asgard’s race be worse:<br>Your doom, mendacious tyrant, learn and hear,<br>Ye also shall curse love.” And at this jeer<br>The rage swelled up in Wotan’s godly heart;<br>Forgets the god to play his subtler part,<br>And, like as when the hounds with barking stand<br>About the antlered deer, on either hand,<br>And vex the mighty monarch of the glades<br>Who, for a time, resists their paltry raids<br>With only lazy strength. Then rears his head<br>Above the throng, the meadow swims with red<br>And curdling gore as charges he the throng,<br>Invaded their ribs with cruel horns and strong:<br>Not otherwise than this Valhalla’s king<br>Rages upon the owner of the ring.<br>And as he rushes forward to the blow,<br>And gleaming eyes their owner’s passion shew,<br>And upwards Wotan did his weapon raise,<br>Loge the prudent, Loge far more wise,<br>Seizes his masters [sic] arm and softly says:<br>“Reserve your anger king, for other days,’<br>But, turning to the dwarf, he gaily sneers:<br>“No doubt to thee, your scheme sublime appears;<br>You taunted us with deeming you a child<br>When we our homage on your spirit piled;<br>Accept you then, who are in wisdom great,<br>That we believe the legend you dictate?<br>Prove you the power you say the Tarnhelm grants,<br>Change thou thy shape. Fulfill your empty vaunts.”<br>The crafty Niblung raised his hoary head,<br>And answered with a look of hate and dread,<br>“Still rave the dotard gods? And think ye, friends,<br>I do not know your avaricious ends:<br>Shall I a small and feeble beast become,<br>That you my bear the treasure from my home?”<br>The baffled Wotan raised his haughty eyes,<br>And faltered twixt his fury and surprise;<br>But Loge, speaking calmly, said: “My friend,<br>If this in truth be of your power the end,<br>Lying were those who told us of your might,<br>You are not than mere men in better plight.<br>So fare thee well. We go to Walhall’s hall.”<br>Then in a trite the cunning, crafty Troll<br>Forgot his plans, and as a mortal will<br>When moved by pride, performed his office ill.<br>Stung to the quick by Loge’s taunting words,<br>He answers, “Think not dazzling pomp and swords<br>And gleaming halls and tesselated [sic] courts<br>And armour bright and giant reared forts<br>Alone mean power. Nay, in this gloomy cave<br>Lies more concealed than Asgard’s host would brave.<br>Credit ye not my words? Then I will give<br>A sign by which your quavering faith may live.”<br>And with this bitter word once more he set<br>The Tarnhelm on his head. His fingers met<br>And clasped each other till the flesh grew white<br>About the knuckles, trying that he might<br>Compress his willing spirit, every thought,<br>Into the wish the golden Tarnhelm brought.<br>Ha! Wild, unprecedented, weird event<br>That through the godlike forms a shiver sent;<br>For looked they once, and in the ruddy glow<br>The furnace cast across that cavern low,<br>Saw they the uncouth Niblung’s figure stand,<br>Solid in form and breathing close at hand;<br>Then looked again – Oh! horror that they saw!<br>E’en as the snow before the sun doth thaw<br>And leaveth streams where stood the solid mass,<br>E’en so the gods beheld their victim pass.<br>Slow into air dissolved the dwarfish flesh,<br>Melted the bones and teeth to take afresh<br>A body new. And in the troubled air<br>Hovered the spirit like a mass of fair<br>Yet fetid vapour, and alone the eyes<br>Dissolved not in the common mass. Surprise<br>Seized hold upon the gods when once again<br>With groanings like some animal in pain<br>The members in the glow ferment around<br>Those steadfast orbs of light, and all is bound<br>Into one solid whole. Fear Wotan rocks,<br>When stands where stood the dwarf a vicious fox.<br>And thrice he oped his lips and thrice surprise<br>The Father’s speech did bar. The gleaming eyes<br>That did the fox’s evil face adorn<br>Upon great Wotan flashed with Haughty scorn,<br>But Loge of the cool foreknowing brain<br>Renewed the smile which on his lips had lain<br>Before the dark event, and said, “Oh king<br>I now believe the power of your ring.<br>Forgive my foolish words, my scornful smiles,<br>These were to hide my awe transparent wiles;<br>I pay, oh mighty Niblung just, to you<br>The reverend homage which is all your due.<br>The warriors which Valhalla’s chambers hold<br>Do not such marvels of your power behold:<br>A novel joy, this rapturous, trembling fear,<br>Unknown delights that Nibelheim doth bear! 1<br>Show us again, great dwarf, your wondrous might,<br>And let us taste again this fierce delight.”<br>Once more the ruddy fox’s limbs convulsed<br>In effort of desire. The sight repulsed<br>The watching gods who knew what was to come<br>Knew the dread secrets of the Niblung home;<br>Drank they with greedy eyes the wondrous sight<br>And pondered on it in the ruddy light<br>Revealed the coming change. Once more the mass<br>Of snowy fog before the dwarf did pass<br>Into which melted slowly every part,<br>The shining claws, the palpitating heart.<br>And still the ugly spirit hovered o’er<br>The shifting whirlwind, gathering more and more<br>Its specks of dust together, and the eyes<br>Above the ruin of the form arise.<br>Great golden orbs of light with lustrous sheen,<br>And where the dwarf in form of fox had been<br>There writhed a slimy toad upon the floor.<br>Then Wotan darted forward with a roar<br>Of triumph, and his garment gathered round<br>His godly waist. And to the pumice ground<br>He pinned the fragile reptile with his foot.<br>Again the effort of desire did shoot<br>Through Alberich’s frame – it was too late!<br>The Tarnhelm on his brows no longer sate:<br>For Loge – scheming god – had seized the toy,<br>And god a god embraced in solemn joy.<br>Ah! sight of pleasure and of woe! – The cave<br>In deepest gloom was wrapped and hidden save<br>The scarlet oblong which the furnace cast<br>Across the earthen floor, and with its last<br>Expiring rays by distance dimmed alit<br>The farthest corners of the squalid pit.<br>And in the light two godly forms embraced<br>Each other, and each other gladly faced,<br>And Wotan’s golden locks seemed brighter yet<br>As every hair the gleaming firelight met,<br>And Loge, skillful, fair and slight withal<br>Enraptured stood before his master tall.<br>Beneath the other’s foot, in dismal plight,<br>– A contrast to the other pleasant sight –<br>The reptile sought its bleeding limbs to tear<br>From under that proud foot that crushed them there.<br>Then turned the mighty gods and Loge grasped<br>The toad in his strong hand and up they passed:<br>Up winding clefts the rocks had rent apart<br>In deep convulsions of the earth’s deep heart,<br>Up tunnels long, down which the freshening breeze<br>Odourous with the scent of lands and seas<br>Unnumbered, swept to choking Nibelheim.<br>The gods laughed loud, for, having been a time ,<br>In that foul den whose secrets few would dare<br>Rejoiced once more to breathe the upper air.<br>To that dim shadow land of unknown space<br>Where twilit dwells the great immortal race –<br>I speak of Asgard, that mysterious hall<br>Which is the home of gods: that mountain tall<br>On which it stands, I speak of – to that shore<br>The gods their toad-formed victim gladly bore.<br>And as they neared the godly place on high<br>A thousand voices filled the azure sky:<br>Across its depth a thousand wondrous things<br>Floated at ease or hastened with their wings; –<br>The flying steeds that bear the Valkyrie maids<br>And mighty serve them at their bloody raids.<br>As through the twilight winged the gods their way<br>In the last light of the departing day.<br>Out flew the warrior maidens bravely armed,<br>And music shrill the listening ear alarmed<br>– The music of the storm: the failing light<br>Revealed the lovely forms in armour dight.<br>And first of all that eerie cavalcade,<br>Whom every Valk’rie duteously obeyed,<br>Great Wotan’s daughter rode, Brunhilda named,<br>Whose beauty would the fair of earth have shamed.<br>Then clashed a thousand spears. A joyous shout<br>Through and above the storms wild song rang out,<br>The multitude of Valk’ries joyous cheer,<br>As sound of joy to gods; no man may hear<br>That cry and live: thus sing they when they bear<br>The bravest warriors from the battle sore<br>To live in Asgard’s bliss for evermore.<br>So, with this mede, the flying train drew nigh<br>Through the resounding fathoms of the sky<br>Sweet in the twilight. And the gates of gold<br>Upon the well poised hinges open rolled<br>And gave admittance to the gods. They went<br>Onwards and upwards with the eyes intent<br>Of all the gods and heroes on their path,<br>And on the reptile which in frenzied wrath<br>Quaked in their iron grasp, and as they neared<br>The hall of Clouds, a radiant form appeared – Fricka –<br>great Wotan’s spouse – she comes and leaves<br>The hall where cloudy fates she softly weaves.<br>Her stance is sad, her eyes betray her woe:<br>But Wotan loudly calls to her . . . . . . . . . . . .<br>(caetera desunt)",

It occupies thirty-two pages of a folio note book, and is elaborately written, in black ink, with the characters names, episode headings etc. in red. The volume bears for title, ‘LOKI BOUND and other poems’ by C. S. Lewis. The stage directions for this tragedy read as follows: – “The scene of this tragedy is laid in a wild, volcanic valley, surrounded by mountains of the most precipitous description. In the background is a vast mountain on the top of which stands a very beautiful and mysterious city, from whose gate a bridge in the form of a rainbow leads down to the neighbouring hills. The left of the stage is supposed to lead off to this bridge. Therefore the gods and the chorus make their entrance through it. The right, whence Fasholt enters, leads to Jottumheim. The scene is the same throughout, and action begins in the evening. In the foreground must stand an altar, a lake, or some such mark, to serve as a centre for the grouping of the chorus.”]<br><br>[Warren Lewis continues: “Loki’s opening speech, for which ‘sombre and eerie’ music is required, reads thus: –”]<br><br>This is the awful city of the gods,<br>Founded on high to overlook the world;<br>And yonder gabled hall, whose golden roof<br>Returns the sinking sun’s red glare again<br>With twofold force, is Galhall. Yonder throne<br>That crowns th’ eternal city’s highest peak<br>Is Odin’s throne, whence once the impious Frey<br>With ill-starred passion eyed the demon maid.<br>Fair is the city while the mellow light<br>Caresses every bulwark, while the cliffs,<br>Some, standing forth, with borrowed splendour shine,<br>Whilst others in the purple shade retire.<br>Aye surely, too, it seems impregnable,<br>Perched high above all fiends and monsters dire<br>Out of their reach – yet if my soul speak sooth,<br>Not long shall she be fair, not long have peace.<br>For soon the red birds cry at Ragnavik<br>Shall muster all the sons of night for war,<br>And the fierce brood from Surtur sprung shall come<br>And plant their grisly hosts about her walls.<br>And I shall shed no tear at Asgard’s fall:<br>Nay rather will I join the demon band,<br>And with my monster children at my back<br>Defy my erstwhile masters. For know this,<br>All mortals, that tho’ I enjoy the name,<br>The glory, and the hollow, hollow pomp,<br>The worship and the common reverence paid<br>To gods, yet I have never been of them.<br>For, in the dawn of all, ere time began,<br>Or haughty Asgard overlooked the world<br>Or men had come to being, and when still<br>Great Ymer’s corpse lay wallowing in the gulf,<br>I walked with Odin through the shapeless void.<br>Ah! We were brothers then, and then we pledged<br>Eternal friendship in those earlier times<br>- Fool that I was! But as we looked around,<br>And viewed the wild chaotic waste, the sun<br>The moon, the stars, all ignorant of their tasks,<br>Knowing not each his place, then Odin told<br>How he would build a world a home for man,<br>And lay the Ocean round it like a cloke;<br>Confining to its utmost marge the vast<br>Uncomely giants and the monsters fell;<br>And over all that lived create the gods<br>Companions to himself, and he proposed<br>To make the conjuring dwarfs and beasts and men,<br>Building for each its habitation meet.<br>But even in that early age I saw<br>The awful error and injustice dread.<br>Then, knowing what I knew, addressed the god.<br>“Odin! And who art thou to make a soul<br>And force it into being? Who art thou<br>To bring forth men to suffer in the world<br>Without their own desire? Remember this,<br>In all the universe the harshest law,<br>No souls must ever die: it can but change<br>Its form and thro’ the myriad years<br>Must still drag on for aye its weary course,<br>Enduring dreadful things for thy caprice.”<br>He answered darkly, with uncertain words<br>Hiding his thoughts. And when I would have called<br>The new made universe to sleep again,<br>Me he forbade, and with his magic power<br>Bound as his slave, bound me to work for him.<br>Thus, therefore have I lived thro’ all these years,<br>Forced to obey the mighty criminal,<br>The father of injustice, he who makes<br>Sorrow and pain on earth, in heaven strife.<br>But not for ever shall his rule endure,<br>And even now in plans unknown to him<br>I set on foot destruction for the gods.<br>In Asgard, stone on stone shall not be left<br>And all the gods shall perish – haste that day.<br>Let all of them such pains as they have caused<br>Soon taste in full and learn what sorrow is!!<br>Curse them, the light-souled gods! Yea, curses on them!!<br>What form is this that glistens up aloft,<br>Athwart the gathering darkness? What that cry<br>Echoing wild across the liven clouds?<br>Lo! The bald ravens flutter down to earth:<br>‘Tis Odin that I see. The cloud grey steed<br>Flies through the storm clouds, and upon his back<br>The grim creator of the world is borne.<br><br>[Warren Lewis writes: “The entry of Fasholt, for which ‘bluff, swinging’ music is asked, is handled thus: –”]<br><br>FA. “Hail strangers! Who are ye that sit alone<br>Thus brooding in the cruel winter night?<br>Nay, answer not; for I perceive myself,<br>Ye are the high gods’ kinsfolk, and ye wait<br>Doubtless to watch the building of my wall.<br>Well, rest assured of this: it shall be done,<br>For I am bent on gaining that dear prize,<br>To cheer my lonely home in Jottumheim.”<br><br>[Warren Lewis writes: “Then follows the episode of the maddened horse and Fasholt’s exit, after which succeeds the following song for the chorus which is obviously the ‘dawn music’ referred to: – ”]<br><br>Yonder, over the hill, the pale precursor of Billing<br>Paints with a ghostly line of white that corner of heaven:<br>Down in the silent woods, to the Westward, buried in shadow,<br>Tho’ it be still dark night, yet every bird hath awoken.<br>Borne on the chill night breeze, a restless whisper ariseth,<br>Where they are stirring below, chattering down in the thickets.<br>Now, with a ruddier tint, the roofs of adorable mansions<br>Gleam in the city above, high in impregnable Asgard.<br>Lo! He is coming at last, the sun, and wherever he touches<br>Mountain or wall with his rays, with his life giving breath he ignites it.<br>Now from the vale and the hill, from the throat of many a songster<br>Poureth the song of the dawn, the song that is old as the mountain.<br>Gone is the night of our fear: let us greet the day with rejoicing.<br>Praising, each from her heart, the Norns that have pitied our sorrow.<br>Who cometh hither in haste, so wild and so eager for tidings?<br>Surely over the brow of the mountain Loki appeareth.<br><br>[Warren Lewis writes: “The drama closes with Loki’s rejection of Odin’s proffered pardon and friendship, and a short final speech by Odin, for which Clive asks ‘some inexpressibly sad, yearning little theme’: –”]<br><br>OD. “So be it then. The day<br>Of doom at last has fallen. Wo is me,<br>Never again as in the days of yore,<br>To clasp thy hands in friendship, or to walk<br>Together through the chaos, as of old<br>Ere yet the worlds were builded! Thou alone<br>Couldest be my friend, or understand. For these –<br>Gods, men, or beasts, what are they but my self,<br>Mirrored again in myriad forms? Alas,<br>How weary is my soul .......<br>But let us come,<br>Oh, maidens, and repair to heaven’s halls.”<br>(Exeunt Odin and Chorus.)<br>THE END.<br><br>[Lewis also quotes Loki in the following line from the poem in Surprised by Joy: “I pay respect to wisdom not to strength” (115).]",

        textProvided: "[Warren Lewis writes: “Here we have another fragment which appears to have been written about the same period [1923]: –)”]<br><br>The silence of the night upon the stroke<br>Of midnight like a bubble snapt and broke<br>Into ten thousand clamours. Forests wide<br>With leagues of oaks whipt over to one side<br>Came roaring out of slumber, scattering birds<br>Like dead leaves up the sky. Half spoken words<br>Snatched from the lips of shepherds that lay out<br>Rose wheeling and became a giant’s shout<br>Over six counties. In his turret room<br>Hippolytus woke shrieking in a gloom<br>That staggered like a ship: the clothes were blown<br>Out of his clutching hand. With ocean tone<br>The seven-mile-crested waves of air were hurled<br>Against his walls. The doors of half the world<br>Seemed banging in his ears. The hollow halls<br>Echoed like caves beneath him. On the walls<br>His hanging helmet clanged and on the floor<br>He heard the carpets flap. Then more and more<br>Came other noises through the wuthering wind,<br>Cat calls that raised the hair and drums that dinned,<br>Struck cymbals, screaming voices and the sounds<br>Of divine beasts at mort and gaining hounds<br>Baying their thirst, that nearer, nearer rang<br>Now in the street, now at the door. He sprang<br>Naked from rest, quivering from heel to head<br>Dry mouthed. The dogs that slept about his bed<br>Crouched whimpering at the door with fangs laid bare<br>In foam, and on their backs the roughening hair<br>Rose stiff. With fingers fumbling round about<br>The straining latch he loosened and thrust out<br>The chamber door into the wind, hard pressed,<br>Labouring with shoulder weight and panting breast<br>Choked like a fish upstream, then, for a space<br>Dizzied with moonlight stabbing his flushed face,<br>Then – forward, where the dogs before him went<br>Flat eared and nosing on a fiercer scent<br>Than earthly quarry had. In haste he passed<br>Blind labyrinths of the house and came at last<br>Forth on the street. None stirred. As clear as noon<br>Showed every stone and tile. That night the moon<br>Had slipt her moorings and with one huge eye<br>Through headlong clouds flooded the ruined sky<br>Low blazing to the earth. Immense and blind,<br>As if at dawn his shadow lurched behind,<br>A monstrous escort up the empty street,<br>Measuring uneven strides. And now his feet<br>Fell on cool grass; wide fields before him lay,<br>Hedgerows with flowers shut up and ghostly may<br>A faintest perfume fluttering the dim air.<br>The great hill-voice was calling everywhere<br>Breathing sharp strength upon him. Now each limb<br>Ran riot, charge with god. Through coverts dim,<br>Up slopes where the uncounted daisies sleep,<br>Slant woods and the high tracks of wandering sheep,<br>Up winding glen, riven gulley, cragg’d ascent,<br>– The wild goat’s path – bleeding and mired he went<br>Up to the hills, away.<br>Then suddenly<br>Running beside the prince there seemed to be<br>Innumerable hordes of beast and man.<br>Under his feet the little foxes ran:<br>Wings smote upon his temples. Often he felt<br>The hoarse breathed mountain bear with shaggy pelt<br>Brushing his thighs. Women with skirts caught up<br>And revellers fresh crowned from the full cup<br>And maudlin pipe, ancients with silver head,<br>Young children, priests, merchants, and maids unwed<br>Ran there with labouring breath, wide gaping mouth,<br>Some naked, wounded some, all parched with drouth<br>In the burning throat; but fiercer burned the fire<br>In heart and bloodshot eye, the insane desire<br>Fixed towards the cloven passes and the bare<br>Storm-fostering heights. Around them everywhere<br>The houseless hills made carnival; the trees<br>Strained with the mimic noise of raging seas<br>In orgy to the wind. Green boulders torn<br>From mossy rest down the full streams were borne<br>Breaking the greenwood. Break. Break everything,<br>Break the old world for life is on the wing<br>To strange adventures. Dian’s out tonight.<br>Brothers, how fair you are. See, red and white,<br>See, the ghost hounds before us in the dales,<br>The moon dogs. Onward now. The spirit fails,<br>The brain cracks. Earth reels under us. Faster yet,<br>Lead, Goddess, lead. The bracken dewy wet<br>Gleams diamonds and the white enormous moon<br>Dazzles the eyes and fills the heavens. Now soon<br>She will be here herself, the Cold-of-the-Air<br>The freezing Chastity, the haggard fair;<br>Mania is in her feet, and in her face<br>The hopes of the long dead. We of the chase<br>See but her shoulders. Lead. Lead on the pack.<br>Brothers, I have grown hound. I smell the track<br>I am all nose – Look. Look; with flanks of snow<br>See where the quarry flies – it is a doe –<br>It is a lion – it’s a man –<br><br>[Warren Lewis writes: “In the same note book is what appears to be another beginning of the same poem; in this version however ‘Hippolytus’ becomes ‘The King of Drum.’ The storm and the hero’s awaking are told in much the same, often the same language as in the version above, but the poem is in a lighter vein. After the hero’s entry into the moonlit street it continues: –”]<br><br>But soon his feet<br>Ran in the singing grass, by leaping hedges<br>That flogged the entangled stars, by reeds’ and sedges’<br>Dry treble in steep glens: upward to where<br>On the higher slopes the huge ninth wave of air<br>Caught him behind the knees. Holm oak like bows<br>Bends double. The leaves race. Among them goes<br>Head-over-heels the king – one pace in thirty<br>Touching the earth by luck – through clean and dirty<br>A king of the dead leaves. Oh night, be dumb,<br>Cover his shame. Whisper it not in Drum<br>How Majesty scuds breechless, blown away<br>Like washing from the line: up past the grey<br>And niggard grass of the heights, further than sheep<br>Climb furtherest, through the pines and heathery steep<br>Up to the moon, straight on.<br>There suddenly<br>Crowding the nine leagues ridge, the king could see<br>Innumerable hordes – beast, woman, man.<br>Nuzzling his feet, tongues out, the foxes ran.<br>Wings lashed him in the face. Often he felt<br>The wheezy mountain bear with icy pelt<br>Brushing his side. But the men – alas for Drum.<br>Why should my lord Archbishop home hither come<br>Showing his teeth so yellow, and except<br>His mitre, bare as an egg? And now he has leapt<br>The chasm<br><br>[Warren Lewis writes: “Another fragment of the ‘Drum’ version: –”]<br><br>The rough breathed mountain bear with icy pelt<br>Brushing him. Then came whinney and drumm’d hoof<br>And over his head a momentary roof<br>Of darkness: and he ducked: and square between<br>The vast moon and his eyes, one moment seen,<br>Dead black the alighting horse appeared – a shape<br>Well known – his horse – how should the brute escape?<br>Was he not stalled – are the grooms mad? And now<br>Flicking irreverent hoofs at our dread brow.<br>Oats are the devil.<br>The men – alas for Drum.<br>Why should my lord Archbishop hither have come,<br>Showing his teeth so tawny, bare except<br>His mitre and soft beard? And now he’s leapt<br>The crevase (eighty years upon his shoulder)<br>Laughing, amid young lads, and no lad bolder,<br>Nor, by the Lord, none fairer. Who’d have thought it?<br>What has alighted on his limbs? He caught it<br>Out of the moon. He spread both hands and dipped",

He is shameless, with the rude voice of a shrill scourge, cold-hearted and ungenerous to all. Hold-ing in contempt the customs of the Muses and of mortals and immortals, he forever speaks with menace and relentless vulgarity. To insult from his pulpit those who have no way to answer back; to espouse as well what must not be tolerated; and to terrify too female undergraduates in their vivas: these make up his chief delight.

When she appears at the opening of Act IV, Lewis heralds her coming with:]<br/><br/>But soft! The fair Egeria<br/><br/>[and addresses her in a reworking of Hamlet’s famous words to Ophelia:]<br/><br/>Nymph, on thy typewriter<br/>Be all my jobs remembered.<br/><br/>[Lewis’s reliance upon the long-suffering secretary during his vice-presidential year is apparent from a scene in the drama where she pleads with him to respond to overdue requests for feedback from unsuccessful candidates for admission, and to look over the agenda for a forthcoming meeting of the college’s main teaching committee, the Tutorial Board, known as the ‘T.B.’ Lewis responds in another Shakespearean pastiche, playing on Hamlet’s ‘What’s Hecuba to him or he to Hecuba?’:]<br/><br/>Fairest maid<br/>I have no time. What’s the T.B. to me<br/>Or it to Hecuba? Make the agenda up <br/>And set down what you will.<br/><br/>[Dismissing the serious business of college governance in this way, Lewis beats a hasty retreat—with the famous stage direction from <i>The Winter’s Tale</i> ‘Exit pursued by a bear’ suitably modified:]<br/><br/>Exit pursued by a Secretarie<br/><br/>[In a later scene, the noble Egeria,]<br/><br/>Never so wearie, never so in woe<br/><br/>[like Hermia before her, searches the ominous wood of the Magdalen grove]<br/><br/>with fix’d intent<br/>To button-hole a lost Vice President<br/><br/>[finally giving into fatigue and sleeping.

The gentle conies<br/>Know no agenda save to get their kind,<br/>Nor do the dappled deer.<br/><br/>[{73} As vice president, Lewis was obliged to attend the regular meetings of the Air Raid Precautions Committee, tasked with ensuring the college’s compliance with the university’s detailed directives.

But, just as Lewis announces that the best wine will run in the cloister pump until midnight in celebration, a messenger arrives to repeal the earlier directives and replace them with others:]<br/><br/>All is revoked.
