# csl-opera-obscura
A catalog of C.S. Lewis's obscure and newly published works. Built with React and Materialize.

# Purpose
This bibliography is an exhaustive collection of all <b>published</b> works by C.S. Lewis, however fragmentary, that are, for the most part, not obtainable in the well-known and much more easily obtainable volumes of essays, poems, stories, letters, and diaries edited by Walter Hooper.

# Sources
However, many of the following entries in this list, and some of the notes on them, are drawn verbatim from Hooper’s indispensible bibliographies in 
- C.S. Lewis: A Companion and Guide (New York: HarperCollins, 1996), 799-883
- C.S. Lewis at the Breakfast Table and Other Reminiscences,ed. James T. Como (1992, new edition), 250-301, and 
- Remembering C.S. Lewis: Recollections of Those Who Knew Him, ed. James T. Como (San Francisco: Ignatius, 2005, 3rd edition), 387-492.
    
I have supplemented, expanded, or corrected Hooper’s entries as necessary, in addition to adding dozens of my own. I have not used Hooper’s long-outdated first bibliography, which can be found in Light on C.S. Lewis, ed. Jocelyn Gibb (London: Geoffrey Bles, 1965), 117-60. 

Paul Tankard’s meticulously researched article, “Notes on the Bibliography of C.S. Lewis,” Notes & Queries, vol. 263, no. 3 (September 2018), 432-8, also proved invaluable in unearthing and cataloguing several obscure letters and blurbs.
                        
# Omissions
Texts that were originally published only in part, but were later superseded by a complete or at least somewhat more complete printing, have usually been omitted. For example, Walter Hooper’s Preface to Kathryn Ann Lindskoog, The Lion of Judah in Never-Never Land (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1973), 9, contains a brief passage from a realistic novel written by Lewis around 1927. This is the “Easley Fragment,” now published in full in Seven: An Anglo-American Literary Review, vol. 28 (2011), 5-15. Accordingly, only the latter reference is included in this bibliography. Likewise, many of the blurbs and letters catalogued by Tankard in “Notes on the Bibliography of C.S. Lewis” also appear in Hooper's Collected Letters, and have been omitted from this list.
