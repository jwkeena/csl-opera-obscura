# csl-opera-obscura
This bibliography is an exhaustive collection of all published works by C.S. Lewis, however fragmentary, that are, for the most part, not available in the many well-known and accessible volumes of his writings edited by Walter Hooper. Texts are sortable by year, title, reference, and type. Types (prose, letters, diary entries, and poems) are also filterable. Built with React and Materialize.
